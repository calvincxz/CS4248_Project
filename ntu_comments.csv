"""As a girl in an engineering course that has slight relations with other courses that are known to dress well and put more into presentation. I will never understand why we are always put on a chopping board of sorts for the way we dress. I dress up often even to class because that’s what makes me feel comfortable enough to leave my house or hall room, I don’t wonder or fantasise about anyone falling in love with me either, I don’t care what they think about how good I look — I just don’t have the might to leave my room without feeling like I’m good enough appearance wise. And all I get are my peers (mostly guys) implying that I’m too focused on my appearance and when girls don’t put in effort on their looks, we get confessions implying that a certain faculty is better and how we should put more into our appearance.

I really don’t want to comment about how engineering guys look either, since I don’t take much mind to it. But out of spite, I would like to point out that engineering guys and their dri fit army pants slippers combo isn’t exactly the best fit to criticise others either, even shallowly. (Then again, I genuinely don’t mind, I’ll befriend you no less whether you dress like that or not.)

Ultimately it’s still an institution and I don’t see a need to critic and pick on others for their appearance because it doesn’t fit your molds and assumptions, unless your project partner forget to wear long pants and cannot enter lab and youre forced to do it alone, know your place before criticising others on their looks.""

""Screw that motherfxxxxx and son of bitch security guy (old man) who took my photo at south spine today study area in the evening.

Basically he took me to put on my mask. I complied but “reluctantly” put it on (took few seconds to put on). He walked to other side and walked back. Then secretly took photo of me as my mask never cover my nose. I adjusted then confronted him why secretly take photo. Under the PDPA ACT, it is an offence to take photo of someone without permission. I then proceeded to take his photo for records before he walked away.

So damn extra. No wonder he is only a security guard who don’t even know his roles and responsibilities.没出息的家伙"
"""How did I managed to woo my GF?

Fews years back in hall, I decided to buy some snacks and cookies for a random person in hall since finals was near. I walked around the corridor and hang the bag on the door handle with my encouragement notes and contact number.

She dropped me a text to thank me because she had a thought of buying snacks for finals. We continue to exchange messages after the finals.

TADA! We just celebrated our 4th year anniversary.

"""How fair is it for a mod that have mcq as assessment all along (mcq throughout the weeks and finals, UE mod) to switch to peer-reviewed essay? Basically the new assessment have students write one essay, this essay will then be reviewed by four random peers (online mod all the way, about 500 ppl, never met one another). Only 10% of the marking will be monitored by the prof or TAs. And this essay will contribute to 35% of the mark.
I think this is an unfair assessment as
1. Isnt there conflict of interests to have peers marked essays? Somemore it has a 35% weightage which is not small at all.
2. Prof can claim they will ensure fair marking by monitoring 10% of the essays, but what about the rest? What happens to the majority of the essays which might be incorrectly marked?
3. If 500 ppl is too much to assessed individually, is the nrw assessment criteria not carefully set?

Im open to opinions, please advice."

"""Responding to #NTUConfessions29729, I am a year 3 film student from ADM and I have also heard rumours about the girl who was bullied from the seniors, who are in the same batch as her.

I just want to say that it is not that easy to ignore rumours in this day and age and we can be easily misguided. I dunno about other schools... but in filmmaking we kinda have to help one another’s projects and it is best not to burn bridges. When the seniors asked us to help on their film projects, normally we as juniors will go and help out to gain experience. Many times we hear conflicts that happen between classmates, and we tend to listen to the majority? There are also times when I realised that group of seniors are really toxic, but there’s nothing I can do about it because I’m helping them out for their project and they are my seniors, who have an authority over school facilities and equipments... As selfish as it sounds, most of us just want to turn it into a blind eye and act blur lol

Another thing that I am trying to say is that because of the manipulative clique of seniors, maybe many other people were misguided by the impression of the victim. I also thought the victim was what that clique of students said, and because I don’t know the victim personally, I assumed that she was like this and went along with it. I think a lot of people were in the same situation as I am, and soon it escalated because nobody addressed the rumours and confronted the clique (maybe too scared to talk to them).

I really dunno much about what happened but this is just my view, I could be wrong :/"
"""I graduated and recently started working. There was a male colleague who was super nice to me at the start. He would slowly guide me, ask me along for lunch, and he approached me to ask if I needed help before I even asked. He even brought me out alone to dinner once. Both of us are attached To our own partners and he is engaged and I have no feelings for him in the romantic sense even though I do find him attractive cause he is tall and quite good looking- like I know he definitely attracts many girls but not that I like him that way. I was just happy to have a nice colleague. But recently he has been quite cold towards me, feels like I did something wrong? Suddenly he isn’t that nice colleague anymore and it feels like how my ex treated me, warm and friendly and suddenly turning cold. Idk why but my behaviour didn’t change from the start. Anyway but I love my boyfriend the most and I tell him all about the guy too so yeah, just wondering what went through this guys head :/""

"""Responding to #ntuconfessions29729. As someone who was quite close with the victim, I definitely saw the clique whispering snide comments about my friend. Despite trying to reason with some of the gossipers, I realise that a large part of what they said was not unfounded. She had actually committed said things that left even the closest few to her feeling betrayed and very perplexed. The clique definitely did exaggerate jokingly (or in hints and inside jokes) and bring it up in gossipy conversations when there was no need to, and that was very wrong.

BUT I don't feel that there was manipulation of the narrative. Furthermore, with the nature that the situation had turned out, my friend had caused the spread of the rumors by refusing to have a respectful conversation and she was the one who SPREAD IT FIRST.

I hope that NTU confessions can be more impartial about this and not try to set a fixed narrative.""

"""I was a bit sad today after meeting my mom. Due to family's issue, I moved out alone after graduation and my mom and sister still stay with my dad. Ever since when I was in secondary school, their marriage has some problems and they have been talking about divorce all the way until I'm 24 now. I was scolded by my mom that I don't care about her and I enjoy my life after moving out from the house. At the same time, she still has to face her husband and she doesn't want to go to my father's side for CNY. It's just very tedious. I suggested that she can move out if she wants. Then, she silenced for a while and became very irritated. Actually I think I am being very direct to her. I feel that the relationship of her and my dad is worse than stranger and no one wants to do anything to restore the relationship. My grandma has told me to stop getting involved in their problem and move out to have my own life. I want to help my mom, but I really don't know how to help her. I suggest her to move out, she also doesn't want to try. It is also bad for me as a daughter to suggest to her that she should apply for a divorce. Sometimes I really get so drained and tired to listen to her saying the same thing again and again throughout these 9 years. She has so much complaints and unhappiness in this marriage. She kept saying that she wants to divorce, but I really don't know whether she means it or not. Every time she has problems/fight with my dad, she came to talk to me. I hope she can be happy, but I really very tired of this already. After I moved out, I feel a lot happier without seeing both my parents together at a single living space as I am no longer sandwiched between them. My mom said I didn't care about her and left her alone there. I don't know how to help her. I asked her to move out, she also said no money. I said I will rent her room for her. She also doesn't want it. I feel very upset with my life. Is it like I don't deserve to be happy?

I never intend to do any bad thing or harm anyone. Why I feel so suffocated? I have been trying to do the right thing. She said I only want to enjoy my life without her. but I moved out alone. It's scary to go and look at all the rental flats alone. I moved into the room only by myself and one of my female friends. All the way I have been supporting myself ever since after JC. Why I don't deserve to be happy? I feel very upset. I know she has her own problems. She has been unhappy throughout this marriage. However, after so many years, nothing has done to solve the problem. My mom is stuck there. Since last time, she likes to ask me how to get divorce, I don't want to stay with your dad anymore.

I do have a lot of anger in myself once in a while. I hope my mom can be happy, safe and healthy. But I really don't know how to help her after she rejected all my suggestions. She doesn't want to move out, doesn't want to find a lawyer to file divorce. Nothing can be done like this.

I know everyone has their own problems. My mom wants me to give her some emotional support. But every time when she did this to me. I feel very upset. She poured her negativities to me. I feel very suffocated by all these emotions. I also cannot burden my close friends for these. They have their own lives too. Sometimes I feel very lost. My grandma has told me not to care about their issues anymore. I feel very depressed. I don't want my mind to fill with anger and resentment. I wish to have a peace of mind. I hope all the aversion, enmity and hatred can leave me. Even bad thing happens, it should not make me become a nasty person."

"""Writing this now because I feel like I'm reaching the end of my rope and I don't know how I can continue functioning like this. I would appreciate if anyone has advice about this because I've tried looking this up for solutions but in the first place I just can't seem to explain this properly because there are many intertwined problems I can't pick apart.

I struggle with a critical lack of motivation and it feels like for the longest time, I've had this insurmountable inertia in me that I can only temporarily suppress when I have a deadline coming. Every beginning of a semester I get excited to learn new things especially since I'm in a course that I enjoy. Yet when it comes down to actually doing my readings (my major is extremely reading-intensive) it becomes the worst thing on earth because it feels like my ability to read has severely deteriorated as I'm unable to focus when I read and it just saps any energy I had and I just cannot remember the last time I've gone into class having finished the readings of that week. It's the same for everything. I've put off many important things like applying for internships because I couldn't find the motivation to write a cover letter and resume. I'm supposed to be working on a paper that I was excited to research but now every time I attempt to do my readings my mind just goes elsewhere. Everything I've completed - assignments, duties for extracurriculars, even sending necessaries texts to people - has been the result of many days and weeks of struggling to overcome inertia.

What most troubles me is that it seems like most people do what they do out of some sort of motivation be it securing a better future for themselves, or out of their interest in their pursuits. They may not necessarily enjoy it, but I feel like many people at least have something motivating them. I'm aware of all this, and know the importance of working hard now, yet somehow my brain seems incapable of registering this fact. I don't think my brain knows any form of motivation, and the worst thing is that I actually have the fortune of doing a course I like and yet I'm not making the most out of it. Sometime last year I had a period of time when I found it impossible to think about living because I just couldn't envision a future for myself. I still can't. Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind because I don't understand how I can be like this and I genuinely feel like a dysfunctional failure, and I'm so tired of myself.""

"""As a female compsci student, I won’t deny that wkw and nbs girls dress better than us. I think the reason why there’s such a difference in fashion sense between us and them is because in nbs and wkw, part of their job is to dress to impress. They have to constantly be around people, which is probs why they have to present themselves in the best way possible. On the other hand, there’s really not much focus on dress code in engineering departments. Just look at the way Mark Zuckerberg dresses vs Jeff Bezos. I don’t know why some people like to put us down. Sometimes, we dress up to feel confident, other times we dress down to feel comfortable. And most of the times, we don’t dress up to find a boyfriend. And even if we do, we are certainly not trying to appeal to those guys who love to judge a girl’s appearance.""

"""Guys I know that this might be a lengthy confession (of some sort) but I need some pair of ears. Since this is a very sensitive issue, please be mindful with the replies. A little background of me before I delve into my issue. Coming from a not-so financially well-to-do family, I have always struggled with many issues in life. After my father’s death when I was only 8 years old, my mother became the sole breadwinner and went through so much hardship and she has undergone multiple surgeries (ie back replacement, knee replacement and other operations) to raise 3 children. Growing up, my mother mostly spent her time working in a provision store and hardly has time for us and in fact, we hardly had any family time due to the long hours of her work. In fact, my siblings and I were mostly left unattended whilst we were growing up.

Throughout my education life, I have always been an average student. I had to study very hard for me to progress through my primary and secondary school life. Due to the fact that my mother was uneducated and my family’s financial constrain, we hardly had any tuition and we had to really strive hard for ourselves. In fact, our gross income hardly exceeds $1800. Thankfully, 2 of us managed to get into the local university. Growing up, I never saw a relationship with a significant other as an important issue. What was on my mind was that I wanted to be a university graduate and earn enough to cover my family’s expenses. Therefore, after all these years, I was never in a relationship with any females and to be honest, I can be quite clueless in the dating aspect of life. Through the hardship, I have learned to juggle most of the household responsibility (etc cooking, cleaning, washing clothes...) Personally, I am a rather introverted person, and I would not have the courage to get into a relationship.

Currently, I am covering my own daily expenses. I pay for my own transport, bills, food, other necessities and even my tuition loan. Thus far, I have experienced a hard time working and juggling my educational needs. I am currently a second-year mechanical engineering student and my GPA is only 3 and I have been striving to improve. I am willing to work hard and this has been my approach since I have been working when I was 19. I would wake up at 3.30 am and start working from 5 am to 12 noon to work in the opening shift of IKEA.
I have been trying to join various CCAs to know more people and learn from them. There are still many things I am very unaware of. While I understand that many people go though different form of hardship and that I should not compare or complain, at times I feel that It may be very overwhelming. As a matter of fact, I have undergone major depression and had tried to end my life when I was younger but my attempts was always foiled by my teacher as they would notice some changes in me. Thankfully all of this was in the past and I have a very different perspective of life now.

My questions are:
1) How can I improve my grades tremendously and secure a good job. What if I was only able to graduate honours with pass or honours with second lower. Can I still get a good job.

2) How can I improve myself such that I can find a suitable partner who can accept me as who I am. My priority is to graduate and find a job and look after my mother.

3) How can I outgoing and know of many other people and learn from them. I find it difficult to change my introverted nature. Any advice would be greatly appreciated""

"""My parents don't allow me to close my door, it's almost spoilt from the attempts to close it. They tried to kick through it several times, and now just put a key there, and when it's closed they would open it.

When I was in their house on Thursday. From 9.30 - 10am, I closed my door. And my mum opened it 5 times. Then, I went out.
So, now, today, I left it open the whole morning till now. And they keep walking to the room next to me and look at me.

So, I don't flinch when things happen. In pri sch, there was a hussle about spoilt fan on the ceiling that's wheezing and gonna drop, but I guess I was the only one who did'nt hear it, until my classmates told the teacher.

"""I know this came a bit late but I just wanted to post a reply regarding the ""cleaning uncles entering female toilet"" post that I saw. There are some replies that say cleaning aunties also enter guys toilet on a regular basis. I'm assuming what left unspoken was ""so it's fine / not a big deal / we didn't even complain why did you"". While I want to acknowledge that, for sure, guys could feel uncomfortable seeing aunties in their toilet, and both genders have equal rights to a private, safe environment, and I understand if the school was not able to assign a cleaning staff to a toilet strictly based on gender for some practical reasons, I still want to explain why we can't simply switch the gender role in this discussion. The simple reason is that girls are more prone to sexual assaults than boys - there are so many research papers and stats out there that proved this.

And also generally a girl has less physical strength and making them harder to fight back should anything happen. I know this sounds stereotypical, but it is a statistical fact - I'm talking about the population as a whole and not individuals. That is why a simple gender switch does not work in this discussion. I'm not saying that one would get raped in NTU toilet - I believe the school is safe and the staff are all nice people. I'm just saying that it is very understandable that the female op felt uncomfortable , and we can't simply just blindly apply the other gender's situation here without considering the realistic differences.""

"""Hi I’ve recently started tutoring and I wanted to ask for some advice about private tutoring as a freelancer. One of the terms and conditions by this tuition agency is that no fees will be paid to the tutor if parents choose not to proceed with the assignment after the first lesson. Also, all tuition fees will be post-paid to the tutor after every 4 lessons. I was wondering if this is the normal industry practice and what if parents/ tuition centre withholds the payment?

Also, should assignment be terminated by the tutor within a month, tuition fees would be forfeited. What if I find that the student/ parent is not a good match or I’m not comfortable teaching in their home environment?

If parents request for the tutor to go over to their house half an hour early before tuition to “talk about the student”, how should I respond? I feel it is normal for parents to be anxious for engaging the tutor for their children, and I wouldn’t mind having a short call with the parents beforehand, however expecting the tutor to arrive at least 30 mins beforehand to chat seems a little off given that you are only paid for the time tutoring the child.

Another clause from the agency states that should the tutor terminate the assignment 7 days before the commencement of the assignment, the agency will ask the tutor to pay 1 month’s worth of fees to the agency as penalty fees. Is this standard industrial practice as I feel this agency is trying to earn its commission as much as possible without trying to best match the tutor and the student. What are some of your experiences in dealing with such tuition agencies and parents who may choose not to pay the fees and what are some ways that freelance tutors can do to protect themselves?

Are there any red flags that student tutors should look out for both from parents and agencies? What are some ways that student tutors can do to protect themselves from being cheated as I’ve read some bad reviews about this company on Google just as I was about to confirm the assignment."

"""Need to rant. Somehow this sem I am feeling a lot more anxious with regards to quizzes, assignments and group projects. Since there are no finals, there are additional quizzes and assignments which have a higher weightage now. Averages are a lot higher and there is a lot more pressure to do well for every single quiz/assignment/group project. I think it's also about the lack of certainty? Since total scores are lower, usually out of 25 or 30, even if I do better than the average, I'm still not certain if I can get at least an A- as scores among the cohort are quite close. Regarding group projects, for the first time I feel quite lost and not being able to contribute much. Even when trying to settle my own individual part, I struggle to make it up to standards, especially when there are much smarter and capable people in my group.

I wouldn't say that my workload is heavy this sem but it's more of the long term draining effects of uncertainty and feelings of incompetence as compared to other past semesters. I feel heart palpitations and my chest feels tight. Last night, i took quite long to get to sleep as i could feel my heart beating fast and the bottom left of my stomach i could feel my pulse. And even when I am sleep deprived, I will wake up feeling awake and my heart starts beating faster than usual again the next day. When I feel anxious, I would exercise by going for a run and in the past it works but now, after running, my anxiety kicks in again. Yes, I do have friends to talk to and it's the same effect ah. After I return to my room, anxiety returns as well.

I spent yesterday to just rest, relax and recharge, thinking that today will be better. But I realised I'm still the same and I'm gonna really reflect and find ways to understand my inner limiting beliefs, understand my thoughts, why I'm feeling this way and try to overcome it. I think this would be better for me to tackle the root cause.

P.S I've seen a psychologist before and I was not diagnosed with any mental health disorders btw.

"""Sorry for my poor English and irrational talks but this is what im really feeling, come at me with ur burns etc, i dont think it will even affect me as much as what im saying.
I tried my first rs (both evergreen) near the end of year 3 sem1. Got together with a girl, covid19 happens, she went for internship, i studied for the semester. During covid I tried, sending food, secretly fighting for the usage of the family car even tho my parents have to work just to visit her so that I wont caught by the regulations, video calling (min 3x a week). Everything was ok up till the point when she decided to stop trying, fighting for us together. Broke up on covid phase 2 day 1. After 4months of breaking up, I wanted to speak to her, gathering my courage on my birthday (end oct). Little did I realized she got together with one of the interns from the company (accidentally came across a pic with her and the new person in it, she had a very bright smile - the one that I know she feels really happy, I should also be grateful there's someone who made her smile again). But, my heart is smashed into smithereens, crying, living alone away from my parents coz I didn't want them to worry about me, immersing myself with OT from my company in year 4 sem 1 (to distract myself - but all of it doesn't even help much).
Friends told me to move on, let go, but idk why I cant, prolly I'm still that stupid thinking that mutual first love will last (stop saying the same thing, saying is much easier than carrying the action out). People said time will heal, but wounds that heals still leave a scar and it may still bleed again and again. I regretted that I didn't treasured her enough, but for now I am overcomed by my emotions to even write this post (rash act that i will prolly regret too - ***Admin you decide if you want to post this***).
Everything starts and ends in the soil. For now, I dont want to burden my internship company with the guidance they gave me if I decided to end my pain (even my manager sent me back today coz i cant hold it back and cried at my workplace - i know i have to be professional, but i still have feelings, i wish my heart can be made up of rocks). Idk what to do, idk what to feel, i lost all interest in the things i liked to do, lost all the will to fight for tmr.

"Dear NTU Alumni,

It's almost the end of the year. While this year is a very challenging year for most of us working folks, it is even more challenging for financially needy undergraduates especially during the period of circuit breaker. These undergraduates depend on the kindness of student bursaries, scholarships, loans from banks and schools, and help from friends and families to ensure that they can get a quality education at respective universities while not having to overly worry about their daily sustenance.

Back in my day as an undergraduate, I was also a financially needy undergraduate as well and thanks to the combination of bursary and student loan, I was able to survive and concentrate on my studies instead of worrying about working part time during course time to supplement my living cost. Now that I started working, I have also given back to the same bursary every year to help pay it forward to future undergraduates.

I would like to urge those who are doing well (especially those in the tech industry / FANG companies) to help your fellow juniors by donating directly to your respective universities' bursaries. This is the time to be generous, kind and prove that we are still caring human beings.

"""NTU

I’m in need of advice on my decisions. I’m the most demure woman among my cliques not just at my company, but also at uni and school. I’m not saying that I lack sexual experience at all, but until today I’m 29 and only slept with 3 men, and all of them are my exes. As compared to the rest in my clique,

I would say all of them have sexual encounters with guys who weren’t their boyfriends or dating partners, such as random guys from dating apps, clubbing and workplace. Despite that, most of them are now happily married, some even have kids and they seem to have a pretty harmony family.

From what I know, many guys tend to despise girls who sleep around with random dudes, but none of my friends with polygamous relationships and flings have such issues. I’m honestly not sure whether they really full disclosed their sexual encounters to their boyfriend or husband, but an important lesson that they taught me is that it doesn’t matter what you do now, it’s what you do later that matters. They said if they’re young and not ready to settle down, and have sexual craving or the urge to be drowned in love and affections, there is nothing wrong with having multiple sex partners, fwbs, or even sugar daddies, as long as they don’t cheat and that’s it.

All that matters is when they are seriously going to consider to settle down and start a family, then it is time for them to stop all these fun before they meet their potential man. All that matters is who the guys see them as of now, but not before, so regardless of the number of men that they slept with, as long as they don’t do that anymore when they are in a serious committed relationship, their boyfriend or future husband will always forgive them. Is that really true?

Like I feel that right now I just came out from a 3 year relationship, and I’m not ready to commit in a new relationship, but I feel like it’s a waste if I don’t “treat” myself well before I really get married and settle down. I enjoy sex a lot but I start to find it interesting to try it with guys that are not my partner. If let’s say I really meet new guys online to find potential fwbs, is it really that easy for me to come clean to my future potential partner? Is it that easy for them to forgive me? Thank you for your advice everybody."
"""To #NTUConfessions29648:

I totally feel the same way as you. Apart from two of my best friends, I generally don’t get invited to group hang-outs and if I want to hang out with somebody, I usually am the one to initiate and I almost never get invited to any gatherings in return.

I used to feel very resentful and jealous about this fact. I felt that my friends were deliberately leaving me out of their fun and that I wasn’t appreciated as a friend. However, due to stuff that happened during this semester, I’ve realised that it was pointless to get angry at stuff I cannot control. Some of my friends really do care for me, but are dealing with personal problems (so they need their space) or simply express their friendship in a different way. I cannot dictate my friends’ choices, nor can I control their lives/how they feel about me.

Instead, I turned my attention to things I could control. Whenever I felt lonely, I would either do my work and be productive, clean my room or just read interesting stuff online. If it was possible, I would go and hang out with my friends who did reciprocate my offers. I’m pretty sure you have at least a few different groups of friends and if one group doesn’t work out, you could always go hang out with another group. Maybe you could reconnect with friends you used to hang around, but fell off the map. That won’t hurt ;)

There will always be things in life that are beyond our control and it’s so easy for us to be consumed by the anxieties/resentment about things that we wanted to happen, but didn’t. Instead, we should focus on what we control and that is our response to the matter. For all you know, maybe your friends do really want to hang out with you, but had those appointments with others booked way in advance, so they cannot exactly be around you at the moment. So sit back and relax, those who are destined to stay your friends will eventually come around, even if they express it in different ways.

Jiayou, OP. You can get through all this :D"
"""Sometimes I just feel like nobody likes me or even remembers me. I’m always the one inviting friends to hang out. If I don’t they’re always hanging out with other people and I’m never invited.

"""Hello to Confession 29640 with your “dictator” dad!
I would first like to say that I also have a very very strict father and it troubled me a lot especially when I was younger and wanted to meet my friends even just for lunch and he wouldn’t let me, etc etc. Without going into details, let’s just say that I have experienced a fair bit of what u have experienced (except for the shouting at friends part, mine only focussed on me). What I learnt through the years is that, while you may feel very hopeless since he’s your dad and it’s like he has full control over you, in reality you are already an adult, past 18 years old and you’re gonna be handling your own life very soon and your dad knows that. I can’t say for sure my dad is like yours but some advice I can give is 1) find out his reasons for being like this. Don’t guess though, really find out if it’s because he doesn’t trust you or doesn’t trust your friends/bf or is he just paranoid? If he really is paranoid or is being unreasonable then maybe talk to your mom or someone in the family and find out what’s the root cause for his being so protective/strict.

And then 2) talk to him - always prepare beforehand how you want to word your thoughts to him, and be very clear about what you think and feel and want, ie. show him you’re responsible for yourself and that you yourself believe you can make your own decisions so you want him to believe in you too. If you can, try not to cry or whine or say “yes” to everything he says. put on your “adult” face and pretend to be strong even if you aren’t. Most fathers believe in what they see not what we say so after we say we can be responsible for ourselves then we need to keep promises that we make and all that too.

He probably won’t immediately give you full freedom but you could make negotiations like, if u increase my curfew to 10 I will make sure to come back on time and not worry u (or stuff like that, depends on what he’s particular about). My dad has gradually loosened his strings over the years but it’s still a constant battle to put up a good front so that he doesn’t think I’m still a kid he can control. we’re all adults here, things will change very quickly if we are persistent and mature in our thoughts! So hang in there ya, your dad will not be your dictator your whole life haha. Hope this helpsss, if not u can send more specific woes and I can try to use my experiences to help you :) All the best!"""

"""I need to ask to not filter this, it’s a really scary but true observation of my life. I’ve wondered, why is only one my life like this?

I’ve never been able to feel love like others do. I’ve never felt highs and lows. I’ve never experienced excitement, addiction, and happiness. I also don’t have heartbreak, hurt, and disappointment. Im developmentally less advanced. I never found song lyrics that relate to my situation. I’ve never shed tears at the raw beauty of songs and wedding vows. I don’t feel moved.

Yes, I did have a boyfriend when I was 18-19? But while other couples were half naked heavy petting at staircases, me and him shopped for birthday cards at the bookshop. While other couples were making out secretly in hidden public spots, me and him ate noodles in the canteen. Most importantly, when other girls spent every night engaging in sexual intimacy, getting hugged to sleep by their boyfriends, I spent every single night sleeping alone in a single bed.

In case it still isn’t Super obvious, I have never even ventured to the first base of kissing. What I do is what normal friends also can do. I am a weirdly pure virgin at this age, never had sex, never had physical touch, never kissed. At all.

This is where the difference comes in: After breakups, other friends who spent their days in deep physical intimacy were so sad they couldn’t eat. They cried all day. Their love is deep, so the pain of separation hit them hard. My “relationship” not even counted by modern standards so I didn’t even shed a tear.

My observations from close friends and acquaintances may be different from you all, I’m not expecting a “omg so true” comment, but I saw a very strong correlation after years : those who are sexually active in relationships feel more empathy and love, while those who are not....can’t feel things as deeply.

When we watch sad movies, those who already had premarital sex were the ones who had tears of empathy streaming down, while me and relationship virgins felt nothing, and one even fell asleep during the plot. (!!!)At emotional short clips or touching proposals, those who regularly experience intimacy and have their parts gently caressed by the opposite sex were the ones shedding tears of emotion. 5 years ago, when our founding father LKY passed away, me and these evergreen girls didn’t cry at all but the grief hit hard for those who do have feelings- Those who experience intimacy and closeness.

From some research, I think it’s got to do with OXYTOCIN, the hormone that makes us bond, makes us form relationships and feel empathy and love. It’s produced during sexual encounters and peaks during orgasm. It is also said that serial killers and criminals have less of this so that’s why they got no conscience.

I have never even touched myself for pleasure. Not sure if that produces oxytocin? I don’t think it’s healthy for me to continue in this dark path with all emotions blunted and numbed. what can I do to find my out of this numb dark hole and see the light again?

I don’t want comments that just agree with me, I need honesty. I need to hear exceptions (if any) and what’s contrary to my Long-held belief. What I say may not be right.""

"""While on this topic of tutorial solutions, some profs really have it easy. A week before my midterms, i emailed my prof about some queries regarding content error on his notes. I even gave him several youtube and web links that i found to be contradicting his notes/slides.

I wouldn't call this irresponsible. Maybe you have more important things to settle. But why would you send your email out telling students to contact this email should we have queries if you're not going to reply?

I double checked my email too, didn't think i sound rude or anything. There's no tutorial for this module since everything is online for it now...

Saw him during my exams and he was just rudely scolding students for leaving 30 minutes before the end of exams like GO BACK TO YOUR SEATS. Excuse me, i believe we're allowed to leave?

"""Speaking about neighbors from hell, I’d like to share my experience of my roommate from hell. I used to stay in hall some years back (One of the older halls with jack and Jill toilets) and I roomed with a friend that I used to be close with in secondary school.

So she have this very princess-y attitude so much so that her parents would come clean our toilet for her every other week (!!?) At some point her mum even asked me “when was the last time u changed your bedsheet? U know u shld change at least once a week right?” She was implying that my presence was dirtying up her daughter’s room pfft. Anw long story short - she won the hall pageant, got very popular, started dating her pageant partner (who was attached to someone else then), I strongly advised her not to be the “third-wheel”, she told him what I said, things got really bad, he (or they) started to bully me.

I was trying to be honest with her that she shouldn’t see a guy who was still attached. It’s just not right. And as a close friend, I didn’t want her to stoop to such a low standard y’know. But I guess she told the guy whatever I said and made him very angry. So after he broke up with his ex-girlfriend, they got together. He started to refer me as “that bitch” and annoyed me every other night in our room by kissing very loudly while I was trying to study. And if that was not cringey enough, they would start lying on top of each other on the bed and kiss loudly (u can literally hear the Muackkks and I got picture proof that this is happening okayy). There were times when he would purposely turn on his music on loudspeakers while I was trying to study. When my roomie asked him to lower the volume he would exclaim “why cannot? I want to listen to my music. I cannot hear if it’s too soft”. It got worse when I was showering one day and they locked the toilet door (from inside the room) and they went out. Locking the main door too. There I was stuck inside the toilet without my phone or anything so I couldn’t get any help. I just kept knocking on my loomie’s door hoping they would come back soon. So pathetic.

I even found out that they dumped our dirty floormat that we have never washed for the past 2 years inside my laundry basket together with all my washed clothes. Sigh I had to wash my clothes again wth.

Initially, I thought it was my fault for trying to “separate” them so I didn’t tell anyone in hall about these bad incidents. Plus I got no one to tell because he was in the same committee as I was in and everybody LOVED him. Everyone think that he’s this very popular, down-to-earth humble and friendly guy and everyone think that he and my roomie were just the sweetest couple in hall. BUT NO, he was a bully. They were bullies. I was never able to study in my own room and if I were to come back to my own room at night, I would need to knock on the door and wait for them to unlock. He would come to the door and ask “what?” WTF THATS MY ROOM TOO. U DONT “WHAT” ME. MOREOVER HE TOOK OVER MY TABLE AS HIS STUDY TABLE AND DIDNT EVEN BOTHER TO CLEAN IT UP WHEN HE LEAVE. IT HAD NAIL CUTICLES, HAIR AND ERASER DUSTS ALL OVER.

Because of him, I didn’t have a great time in hall and I stopped putting effort into the committee that I was in because I was really turned off by this two-faced guy. And I had this weird vibe that he was telling ppl rumors about me. (Cos once he tried to barge into the room when I wasn’t wearing bra LOL (yes he have our room keys) my roommate wasn’t in so I didn’t let him in. He kinda went around telling ppl I was secretly keeping a guy in the room WTF!??!)
So today, I am no longer in contact with my roommate anymore. Sometimes I still feel sad that I lost a friend that once meant so much to me. But life happened I guess. People change.

Thanks for hearing my rant here. Anybody with the same experiences??""

i live for the days i can talk to people one-on-one, to share our deepest thoughts, darkest fears and bravest aspirations, but those days have been becoming rarer as the people i do it with have slowly drifted apart from me, and for those still around i am becoming more reluctant to open up nowadays because whatever i think and say is like black tar. im poison.

im not suicidal or anything, but when my absurdist angst rears its ugly head i sometimes wish a car would just erase me painlessly from existence, along with all the memories of me in everybody ive ever met. to fade into the night, make my final peace, and just press stop. im tired of running. of keeping things running, of running towards (sometimes unchasable) goals, of running away from things.

sometimes i just stand in the shower to feel the embrace of the warm water flowing over me. laying on my bed at 3am hearing nothing but the gentle whirl of the ceiling fan, i cant help but wish i could lobotomise the part of my brain responsible for emotions, so i can stop feeling these emotions and be a better friend and member of society. im sorry for being a shitty friend. im sorry for being so hard to fit in. im sorry for being such a mess.

"""In reply to Confession#29707:
There's nothing to be ashamed about being an introvert. In fact, introverts are the scariest people i know. I'm not talking about being a ghost and scare people those kind no. I'm talking about the kind of work they can produce. The way their minds think, please do not underestimate them.

Having gone through camp twice already, the work that I've seen introverts give is not normal. We can set a deadline from today to 3 weeks from now. My team of introverts has the job done in 2 days.

I'm not saying extroverts can't do the job as well as introverts. I'm not saying we're better than extroverts. I'm just saying to be proud of yourself. People excel in different things. Just because you are not as outspoken as your friend does not mean you're not as good as her.

But to the people giving the interview, please show some respect. Yes, it can be an informal interview. Yes, people may not mind you eating there. But if you are part of the interviewing panel, we expect some form of professionalism. Shooting down almost everything an introvert says just questions your ability as one of the main comm members (i assume you're there cuz u head of something). I would not want to be a part of the team if given the choice, knowing my boss is like that. But of cuz, its just my 2cents opinion.

I mean those who had really mediocre grades and did not succeed in any internships/projects they applied for, but are graduating soon already. How are they that confident of themselves?

In other courses that may not be as ""useful"" as comp sci but perhaps similar cut off points during admission, we may have Dean's list/fch and a plethora of internship/leadership experiences yet we still fear for our future.

Is it oblivion or does being in comp sci automatically guarantee a beautiful future despite getting rejected/ignored on intern/project applications and mediocre grades?""

"""So I got together with my gf when we were both studying in NTU. We have been together for almost 2 years now. We both graduated this year. This is where the issues started. Once we both started working in July. She started to gain weight whereas I started to exercise more. From July till now she has put about 8kg whereas I'm getting more ripped. She used to be an average size girl and now she is fat. Due to this I do not find her attractive at all. Whenever she tries to initiate sex or something intimate I will find some sort of excuse to avoid it. Before you guys say simply break up with her or tell her about the weight issue. I been hinting her for months by asking her to exercise or eat healthy but she keeps replying she dont Care. And she is a strong believer in a guy cannot comment on a female weight. However I truly enjoy spending time with her and want to keep meeting her and chat with her. Just that now when I look at her body its a bit of a turn off. I know its a long post but what do I do.?"
"""In response to #NTUConfessions29793

Yes I do agree that physical appearance is very important and plays a huge part in sexual attraction. However, being in a committed r/s means that your love for him/her as a person should trump physical appearance. If you're complaining about her changes now, what about after childbirth? Women commonly put on 8-16kg during pregnancy and its often difficult to shed the weight after. What about during old age?

Definitely, her bochup attitude is abit concerning bc the weight gain still may not have hit her OR she is in denial. She could also just be a extremely confident and secure person who believes her physical appearance doesn't affect who loves her and her right to be loved. And she is right. BUT with that said, being overnight is still awful for health. By the time she realises ""oh I'm fat and unhealthy"" it may be abit ""too late"" bc by then it would be much harder to lose the weight.

What you can do is perhaps prepare common exercises as dates? Ask her out for hikes, go cycling together, go for pilates classes together or something. It may help to encourage her more if she has someone to accompany her and push her.

I have been with my bf for 8 years. He was skinnier during BMT (who wasn't? HAHAHA) and fattest after uni (well well). In total he has gained 15kg since I met him. If I say that sexual attraction hasn't weaned I'd be lying through my teeth. However I love him as much as life itself and he is so precious to me. We still have sex, but in lesser frequency, as per the norm for couples who have been tgt long enough... I would say that rather than being visually attracted and aroused, we are now more touch activated. LOL. One simple solution could be to, well, simply close your eyes and use your hands to feel instead. Touching won't lie right?

However what I can advise if physical appearance is such a huge deal to you right now, is to think about whether this is the person you want in your life 10 years from now. 20 years. 30. 40. Do you think you can accept everything about her? If not, quit lying to yourself and stop wasting her time. Women have limited time to get married and have babies lol. Nothing wrong with not having babies too, but just don't waste her youth."

"""With regard to 'should i break up with someone because they've gained weight'?

Let me start by saying, i get it. we're visual people, and we've grown up in a world which has always told us that to look a certain way is attractive and so you're a bit put off by your partner gaining weight. but weight gain isn't always a choice. think about everything that's happened this year, there was a fucking pandemic no less. people can gain weight because of mental/medical conditions and just stress/hormones alone. but anyway, just think about whether she's worth more than a body to you. if no, then dump her for her own sake. whether she loses weight later or doesn't, she deserves someone who's not with her just for her body. and also think about whether you might ever be in this situation later. let's say you dump your girlfriend and move on to someone else much hotter and younger even. later when you get married, if you get a dad bod, is it okay for her to leave you for a fitter man?

"""I’ve always been an introvert so it’s not always easy for me to make friends, but recently (let’s just say because of the lockdown) I’ve been spending a lot more time online and clicked with many people (mostly overseas) there.

I know there’re a lot of introverts like me too who find it easier to engage in conversation through a screen, and also just to share feelings (like what i’m doing rn LOL) and maybe it’s these reasons why that I feel a lot more emotionally attached to my online friends.

But on the flip side, I sometimes struggle with this because most online friendships are really come-and-go. Especially when you have very little opportunity to get involved in each other’s lives and the only time you can connect with them is when the both of you are on your phone at the same time. Beyond that we’re often not privy to the details of each other’s lives. Sometimes when replies get slow I get anxious and paranoid that this is the end of the friendship.

"""Replying to #NTUConfessions29820,
I think no course is easier than the others. Each course has its own easy and killer mods. I'm from science and I heard what you've said before. Last year I got dean's list and you know what, I heard some people saying ""Oh no wonder this guy got dean's list, the course seems easier"". I really hate it when people said that. It sounds like I can only achieve it because it's easy, while in reality I studied and did all my assignments tirelessly to get it. And I think hard/not really depends on the modules and the professors as well. I remember having 1 semester where I needed to continuously do 4-6 weekly assignments, some core modules even had 2-4 midterms/quizes, and 5 final papers in one week that one even got me crying after the exam finished (I think I could get good grade because of the bellcurve lol not sure what would happen if it uses passing grade).

I also know some people who got first class in engineering taking some modules in my course and ended up SU-ed them because they don't want it to affect their GPA. But I won't say that my course is harder than the others since it maybe biased because I only know some engineering mods that I was taking, which means I don't know the whole engineering course and I also only took the mods which are of my interest so, you know. The truth is I also tried to avoid taking UEs that are not of my capability and not of my interest.

My point is, if you think your course is hard, don't blame other courses to be easier when in fact they're not. It maybe the case that the course just doesn't suit you well, doesn't match what you're capable of before, or in many cases, i saw a lot of people are just partying and gaming their whole semester yet they ranted when they did bad in exams. If you still want to stay in your course, stop complaining and having that kind of mindset, instead start working on the things that you think will benefit you in the future. But if not, just change to course that you think will suit you better."

And this has been a vicious cycle for my 1.5years of studying in NTU. I have all along been doing things alone (projects are exceptions), and I really fear to interact with people and even if i do start to interact with people, I usually wouldnt dare to take an extra step to ask to join them.

I also know that looking at social media about those ""perfect uni life"" isnt the best place to view how uni life is like (or rather, should be like), but I always see people grouping together and going places together in school which makes me really envious.

I know that I cant blame others for not trying to talk to me, but at the same time I really dont have that much of courage to voice out that I want to join them or be friends with them (friendship as in those on a non-superficial level). I also really dont know what to do, so my plan is to just brace myself for the next 1.5years, because I've already did it for the first half of my NTU life, I'd always tell myself that I can tolerate for another half. Maybe this isnt the best way, but since it works for me, why not?

And maybe, if you dont mind, just maybe, do you wanna get to know me? (even though I'm not sure whether you would see this post) Somehow I feel that we can relate to each other in some forms, yeah. Thats all for my post, thank you to those who took the time to read, much appreciate :)""

I did the same thing 2 years back to my secondary school friends. There was a huge difference in maturity level ever since we all left to pursue different tertiary education paths but i still reached out for years due to loneliness. I stopped reaching out 2 years ago and have not heard from them at all since. People tend to speak about maturity in a positive light but it is actually tremendously lonely to be more mature than others your age. Even with my current friends that took the initiative to reach out on their own, I feel a similar lack of connection due to the maturity gap. Sometimes I wish I am more like others my age. Anyone else feels the same?""

"""I feel very upset today with my work. I don't know how to start this. My boss actually prepared a set of questions for the new sec 1 students. Although the questions are for new sec 1 students, the level of difficulty is another level. My boss also admitted that he took it from the math Olympiad paper. Anyway it involves tedious algebraic equation and the students almost have to ask the teacher for every single question. For one question, for every single line of working, they have problems understanding already. I don't understand why my boss wants to push the students like this. Technically, this kind of math questions will not even come out for O Level E math and A Math. I don't even see a single question of this type from the TYS. The students already have problems solving normal algebraic equations already. Shifting algebra and number across the equal sign are already a problem to them. What's the point of doing questions of this kind of difficulty. I feedbacked the learning level of the students to my boss, but he still insisted the students to do it. What's the point of having such questions when O level won't even test it?

One of the students asked his older brother to solve it. The older brother is also one of our sec 3 students who scored A1 for math. Even student of this level found the questions to be extremely hard, my boss still insists to have that list of 45 questions inside the lesson plan. I feel that it is just a waste of time and focus. I understand that my boss may want to open a math Olympiad workshop in the future. But some of my kids they are NA students. What's point of doing this kind of question that made them demoralized?!

Sometimes I feel that my boss is very one-sided, meaning that he is too stubborn to take it other people's opinion. These new sec 1 students they just finished PSLE, what's the point of torturing them in this way? Even my sec 3 student (the brother) cannot solve it and he came to complain to me how come sec 1 math is so difficult."

It seemed as though she wanted to be fwb. We also exchanged nudes but deleted because we promised each other to delete it immediately after seeing.

But then each time I ask her to meet up, she would ghost me and not meet up at all. Then later texted me afterwards said she was busy. It happened for a few occasions. I was confused if she really wanted to have sex with me or no.

My interest in her died out as nothing really progressed from simply sexting. So I have started ghosting her instead. It has been several months since I last replied her but she keeps on texting me asking me how I am every now and then.

So now I am very confused if she is playing around with me or she really wants to get into bed with me? I did some background check on her by looking at her page. She seem to be legitimate person and not someone who will extort money for sex. Is fwb this hard to find?"""

I finally mustered up the courage to take things offline and was so happy that she accepted it. However, as I was reading up on places to go and showing her the recommendations, she decided to withdraw the idea; saying that she might be uncomfortable with the idea of going out and that she's relatively introverted. Judging from my conversations with her, I somewhat sensed that she's indeed introverted and might be ""socially awkward"" and maybe I might be going too fast. I've known her during my Poly days but was kind of a cowardly dude back then to approach her and it's only recently that we started chatting casually. Just want to get a sensing if I am going too fast and maybe I should slow it down. I am really lost on what to do for my next step. Please help a fellow bro out. Thanks.....:')"""

As an introverted person, I have trouble interacting with people. I went out of my comfort zone recently and received my match from the aphrodite project few months ago.

We chatted on and off on social media. The lunch date during breaks were not too bad to the extent that I actly believed that we stand a chance. I ask her a few days ago if she wanted to progress on in this relationship because I wanted more (physically and romantically). Shockingly, she wanted to remain friends only and was always busy to meetup. I just can't comprehend, why she doesn't want to meetup often despite having time to watch her dramas?

Should I slowly ghost her and abort the plan to take some common modules together with her? I am currently at a loss because there is someone who I recently knew online that has identical relationship goals."""

Surprised to see such an ignorant and narrow minded post from an alum in the tech industry. Of all industries in today's world, the tech and software industry is one of the few that has managed to do away with the regressive norms of hiring grads based on grades and universities. Why should you be given preference simply because you're from NTU? I don't fully blame you for thinking this, because society has been feeding us this bs for years, get good grades, go to good universities and you will do well. This is not true.i have seen both extreme cases.

People who go to world renowned universities and end up in mediocre jobs, and people who come from nowhere and find success. You need to do some introspection and realise that grades only indicate your ability to take exams, nothing else. Although I can't say for sure without knowing the full story, your peer from digipen probably did a better job showing his skills and so must be the better candidate. You need to get rid of your regressive views and stop expecting your degree to open doors. College is just another way society divides people. Do your best and earn things based on your skills. Tech giants like Google hire people who don't even have degrees, what makes you think your NTU degree makes you so much better?""

not denying there could be problems in their existing relationship, but am just wondering months ago he's been sharing about his ex with us and the fact that he got together with this new girl so soon probably shows something...

totally disappointed in him and relationships in general. As a close friend, I wouldn't question his choice but just a curious question in my mind: did he cheat (regardless of physically or emotionally)? only he knows best, and if he did, he should be guilty for the rest for his life... as a friend, witnessing such events really made me questioned ""true love"" when he and his ex have always been seen as a serious and compatible couple that would last really long, never expecting him to break up and be together with another girl so soon and yet, such emotional cheating can happen... is he trying to say that he developed feelings with this new girl while he's in the relationship with his ex?? Of course, he told us there were alr issues in their relationship, saying that it would best if they remained as friends instead, trying to sound so nobel like as if he was the one who walked away hoping that he absence would make her grow... knowing that he is pretty independent, really hope he knows what he's doing... wish him all the best

"""TO ALL THE GIRLS OUT THERE:
(pls send this to all your female friends who got tgt with her guy who had just broken up pls :))

do not ever get together with a guy
1) who has just broken up with his ex for you, claiming that he lost hiss feelings, or
2) who just broke up with his ex but claims he has long been over with her and that the new relationship is not going to be a rebound

speaking from personal experience and all the other sharings from my close friends, this is the worst situation to be in. dont even bother showing or forwarding this your bf if youre in this state, because all he is gonna do is to give you countless assurance but you will never know what's really going on (even he himself may not know the real answer).

in the 1st situation, if he uses ""lost his feelings"", ""incompatible"", ""already had problems in the relationship"" for the break up, HOW SURE are you that he is not going to use it back on you? if he had developed feelings for you and that made him realise that he lost feelings for his then-girlfriend, would this not happen again if he were to meet someone that is better and more compatible than you? yes, he broke with her for you but will he not break up with you for another girl in future? is he using his then-girlfriend as a benchmark to find someone better? find out what he really did before he initiated the breakup with his then-girlfriend (not sure how you are gonna do this to find out the truth, making sure that he did not just intiate the break up all of a sudden without even trying to salvage the relationship)

in the 2nd situtation, why is the feelings long over and yet he was still in the relationship?? is he not doing anything to resolve issues and just blaming it on ""lost feelings"" or is he just wasting the girl's time?

you might be happy for now that both of you are in the honeymoon phase, can you imagine just weeks or months ago, he was just saying those EXACT words that he said to you, to another girl previously? all the "" ILY"", ""this very special date of ours"", ""cherish you alot and will love you forever"", ""would never want to leave you behind"" etc

just a word of advice, dont get together with him until he experience and is over the stage of loneliness (ie. being single on christmas, his birthday, previous anniversary, valentine's) not step by step guidelines to follow but ya, can you imagine just the previous occasion, he spent it with his other loved one and now you. can you accept it? imo, if you were with him over the past few occasions, he would never feel that detachment from a relationship and relying on you for that ""companionshipp"" while still making claims of how different you were compared to his ex, and who knows something might just happen in future.

am saying all these, just to remind all the girls out there not to believe and take what the guys say as it is, no matter how convincing it sounds. i had been in these positions and so do some of my close friends, i learnt it the hard way through countless heartbreaks. from past experiences, all these relationships will never be long-lasting nor stable because you will forever be insecured or worst still, if you a nice/kind person, you would be feeling guilty... whether or not you caused his previous break up to happen.. all these are just to toxic for the long run so please please girls, do yourself a favour. get some time off from these guys if youre in this situation or "" break up"" with him or do not even get tgogther with him in the first place give it some time (months or even year plus) if he really loves you, he will still be single for you by then :)""

"""Dear #NTUConfessions30013 ,

Hey~ just wanted to say you’re absolutely not the only one in this situation.

I was in a similar position just a little while back, but on your friend’s side of things, and what you shared really reminded me of my girlfriend when I first confessed to her honestly. The both of us were afraid of the stigma as well, coming from conservative backgrounds, but ultimately decided that we wanted to give it a shot.

I think that it was a bold but good move that you decided to talk to her about it and communication is super important especially when you’re feeling uncertain. It’s perfectly valid to feel like you’re not ready for a relationship, whether you’re straight or not, and at the end of the day that’s for yourself to decide. If you’re just afraid of what to expect from or how to act in a relationship though, that’s up to the both of you to decide. There is no right or wrong way to love a person or to go through a relationship with them. At the end of the day, as long as the both of you communicate and are on the same page, what matters most is that the both of you are happy and not that you’ve checked off the boxes of what makes up a typical Hollywood romance. I mean, even if you do end up getting into a relationship, nothing needs to change overnight. Things can remain as they were and you both can learn what it means to be in a relationship together.

So I guess the only thing that really remains is to ask yourself if you would be open to giving this a shot? Perhaps in an ideal world where there is no societal pressure or judgement, would your answer still be the same? Maybe try asking yourself why you’re trying to find dates on cmb but declining when they want to meet up as well? At the end of the day, it sounds like this girl really cares about you and you really care about her, so don’t feel too worried if you really don’t end up getting into a relationship with her because if your bond is as strong as it sounds, I don’t think it’ll be broken just because you two are not together romantically. Just continue being open and figuring yourself out as well, things will get easier with time.

Anyway, if you need someone to talk to, you can find us on (REDACTED) (the rest of you on NTU confessions PLEASE don’t troll, we’re genuinely trying to reach out to someone and it wouldn’t be very nice of anyone to get in the way of that)

Good luck and we’re rooting for you!

"""This might not be relevant to everyone, but is anyone staying on campus bothered by the large number of geckos roaming around the halls? Worse still, I returned to my dorm just yesterday to find one inside my room! I'm not really sure how it got in, as both my roomie and I had closed our windows and doors during the sem break after finals when we returned home.

Now, I know geckos are relatively common pests in sg and some of us are not afraid of them, but I still find them creepy and annoying!! Especially when they show up unexpectedly in places (like right under your desk), drop unpredictably from the ceiling /wall (like an acrobat) to inflict some shock/trauma (whether unintentionally or not), and make those annoying mating sounds at night that prevent you from sleeping! All these experiences were from my previous halls. I have encountered very few lizards in my home so this was not a big issue for me, but during my stay in hall, I was visited not by cockroaches but mostly by these small reptiles. I suspect I might have even developed some fear or phobia towards them. Whenever I see one inside my room now, I just freeze in shock and would need help from others to get rid of it.

I'd like to ask if anyone reading this has any good tips for getting rid of these pests? From my previous experiences, I tried to chase them out, only to find them returning a couple of days later. I had to kill one (regrettably) when one of them got so bold that it lurked so close to me, my patience was pushed to the limits and I decided that ""that was it"". However, killing it was kinda traumatising and anxiety-inducing tbh, with it jumping and running around. It's also not possible to ask my friends to kill it every time I encounter one. I have tried mothballs, insecticide, and tried to clean my room regularly but somehow they don't work? Anyone else commonly find these pests inside their rooms too?

TL;DR: I am scared of lizards and I regularly find one in my hall room. Did you have a similar experience and any good tips for getting rid of them? I am a girl btw, if it helps to explain why I am more afraid of insects/pests.""

"""It kills me everytime i think about what happened. How one of the most considerate person I know, could do something so thoughtless? And that if you honestly thought from my pov, for even a little bit, and tried to feel how I would feel in that situation that you put me through. You'd definitely understand why I reacted the way that I did.

I've been searching and searching for answers, how could someone who calls herself a good friend, ever do stuff and say stuff like that and not feel anything, neither empathise nor try to comfort, a friend that was so so sad and hurt by everything that he was put through.

And the worst part is that, even after I tried to swallow my pride and forget the incident, you just ran, instead of communicating. This just isn't right, you just don't treat a friend that cares about you like that.

I still miss you. And it annoys me how much i miss you. But I can't be friends with you anymore. It's so annoying. Why does hearing your name still make me make me happy for a bit. Why does seeing you from afar make me smile. Why am I so damn weak. Why do I still care. Damn it all.

Time doesn't do a damn thing. I hope you realise one day that the person who screwed up wasn't me, it was you. I lost a person who didn't care enough, but you lost someone who cares about you and will continue to care about you till the end of the line...""

"""In reply to #NTUConfessions30065, EE8061 is a very popular gerpe for SPMS students. Contrary to what #NTUConfessions30065 says, it is very easy to score an A if you put in at least 50% effort. There is no presentation and can be used to clear GERPE-BM. The profs have reversed the weightage for finals and mid terms to be (finals:midterms 40:60), previously was 60:40. Inclusive in the 60% for mid terms include 2x report assignment (10% each). For AY20/21 S1, the main focus was on COVID-19 and technology and I feel it would be similar in S2.

For Mid-Terms (40%).. the average in AY20/21 S1 was about 62-65% which is inclusive of the part-time students... and scoring 35 and above upon 40 is easy as the profs will go through sample quizzes every week to prep you. Although questions are not repeated, the style and difficulty remains. For the 2nd half prof, he repeats the sample quiz questions. The quiz is also 1ans for 1qn, no multiple answers so it is very easy to score especially about 4-7 questions are really common sense. Ohya its closed book, MCQs are done in EEE computer lab using OASIS software. Downside, its conducted late at night, to cater to P/T students.

For 2x assignment/report (10%x2), they have not make it a rule to submit via turnitin because ""it loses innovation"" which is what the mod is all about (lol). So... you can paraphrase whatever you need and insert to the report with proper report formats (i.e. proper intro+conclusion).

For Finals... it is 100% open book, you can bring in all the materials you want. For the first prof, after going through sample quizzes every week, he will go through discussion questions which are the type of questions that will come out in finals. Very easy to score as long as you read the long ass paragraph carefully.

First prof is stern and fierce but he gives good tips and teaches well.
Second prof is a little clumsy and you'll not understand what he speaks but he marks very leniently.

Its a good mod to score A if you want to pull up your GPA as theres no confusing business/econ terms. There will also not be any disadvantage if you have no business/econs background or EEE major!!"
"""How do you deal with a bf who does not have faith in your capabilities? For a little bit of context, my bf and me are both studying in MAE and he is one of the better students with a first class meanwhile I am a mediocre student with a second lowers. To me I didn't really choose MAE cause of passion but more of cause I didn't know what to choose.

3 years into my course, I still find my mods really tough and I do struggle quite a bit to keep up but I always try my best to understand concepts. Meanwhile for my bf, he chose this course out of passion and finds it easier to grasp concepts. I can always sense that whenever I talk to him about finding mods or concepts hard he kinda just brushes it off and in a way demoralises me. To top it off, he says he wants to help me(which I really dm) but when theres some basic concepts that I am unaware of, he disses me and says you should know this by now. As a result, I think I may have developed a fear of talking to him about my studies or taking his help. I want to prove myself to him so badly and show him that even though I am not doing as well as him in studies I am able to do better in other things.

I joined hall JCRC and my faculty club to prove myself to him and ended up having a lot on my plate. Even my friends think I am stupid for taking up so many things and they are pretty happy that last sem I was still able to do pretty decent in studies. Yet that doesn't seem to prove my worth to him :( will I ever be enough in his eyes? will he ever see that I am capable? will he ever see that I actually am trying my best? what can I do? any advice is appreciated xoxo""

He said his grandparents also don't care about him. I didn't know how to react as this is the first time having a student sharing such thing to me and his other classmates on that day also get very shocked.

"""So like a lot of ppl, I like to go to the Arc to study. I'm sure everyone who likes to visit the Arc have at least noticed that there's this one rack near the elevators called a ""Trash to Treasure"" rack. It's a nice concept really. Students are supposed to exchange one item that they own with one item on the rack. But, whenever I pass by the rack, I see it getting progressively emptier and emptier.

There are four racks around campus, according to the posters. One in the Arc, one in the Hive, one in the North Hill study room and one in Meranti Hall. Whenever I pass by any of these racks. I see the same pattern; ppl just keep on taking and taking from it (except for North Hill's, seems like North Hill residents are really honest).

It's really upsetting how NTU students can't even be socially responsible when it comes to small things like this. I've been trying to help out by donating some of my items to the racks without taking anything in return. See it as an act to balance the actions of those ppl who just take things from the rack.

If you are one of those ppl who just take things from the rack, I hope you can realize your irresponsibility and attempt to make up for it :)

For other ppl reading this, I really hope we can raise awareness on this issue! Feel more than welcome to exchange things or donate things that you no longer need onto the racks! Sometimes I see nice bags, bottles, and even shirts on the racks, so make sure you go fetch them quickly before I beat you to it!

"""Looking for advice from people who have experienced Academic Termination before and successfully appealed back in. How did you decide whether to continue in NTU or to start over in a new course in another university? I am currently in that dilemma now and feeling very lost as a result."
"""Not everyone is academically inclined. Don't be discouraged by grades. If you are still unsure about what you want to do, just try out all kinds of internships. Keep yourself busy and you'll slowly get a clearer picture of what you want (or not want). And internships are important, more so than your grades (if you're not looking into gov sector or firms that you know are grade-conscious). Most seniors that I know are landing in jobs or big firms, getting higher-than average pay, and they barely had honours. I didn't have any and I found one that I like too with above median pay right after grad (not contractual, not traineeship). All thanks to my 5 committees and 6 internship/jobs throughout uni. This is most probably the reason why my grades are like that, but I enjoyed getting myself busy (and earning the money) than facing the lecture notes.

So to all stressing over pulling up your grades, there's always another way to work things out. Uni is not only a place for studying. Being an NTU student opens the door to a lot of opportunities for you to venture and build your experience. Do it wisely."
"""As MAE graduate of 2015, I struggled with CAD software in my first job, in particular Solidworks. I had to spend my own money to take up courses to brush up my skills to meet my company's demand.

Time and time again I feedback to MAE to change the course curriculum to use Solidworks instead of manual drawing. Sadly, nothing has changed.

We are living in the times where everything can be done on computer. Even movie makers use CGI to create spectacular scene to enhance viewer's experience.

"""This is going to be a long one but I really do need some advise.
During my freshman year, I became close with this friend, J, through an orientation camp and we used to spend most time studying and hung out often together. We were also close together with a few other individuals, and I really liked the time spent with everyone. At the same time, I also had strong feelings for J, and wanted something more, but was afraid that if she did not feel the same way, the group would not be the same anymore.

I did not know what went into my head, but one fine day, I went ahead and gave out some very clear signals of attraction to her, though I had not expressed it out verbally, and I left it as is. I was a coward. I was not courageous enough to say those few words and till today, I still regret that. Time passed and a year went by, and one of our mutual friend, had developed feelings for J as well. He actively sought after her and I wasn’t sure what to do and continued to keep my feelings to myself and even provided him advice. He was however rejected. And I was exhilarated… But why? It is not as if anything would change for me… I was afraid of others’ judgements of me being the second one and that thought of rejection..

Eventually, I tried to keep these feelings away and they slowly dwindled.. but as if that was easy since surprisingly, our group still remained close and I still see her from time to time. Two years later, I managed to find someone else. We share similar tastes, our interests aligned and everything was well. We’ve been together for more than a year now and I think she might just be the one for me… if not for this lingering regret of not properly expressing myself that day. It keeps me up at night every so often, replaying again and again the same scene, and wondering what might happen if I had been more courageous.

Hi.

I'm basically you somewhere a little further down the line. I just graduated after struggling with a Bachelor's Degree in engineering after 6.5 years, also juggled ExCo duties for 2 years, a hobby on a semi-pro basis and a part-time job. I actually don't like engineering, but it's not like I didn't have the aptitude. I can do the math, but like you I also struggled to focus.

I woke up later. I cared less. I exercised less.
Practiced my hobby less, put less effort at my job.
I started to become hollow. I still am.
I wanted to drop out every semester.
I wanted to commit suicide every damned semester.

I got through, somehow, but honestly I feel that the situation hasn't really changed at all.

I don't have anything particularly inspiring to say. I'm sorry. My only advice is to enjoy the little things.

Look forward to a good meal.
Maybe the next episode for your favourite show is coming out tonight?
It's a long ride to and from NTU. Take the time to breathe. Drink some water.
Put the phone away. I know it can be deafening when the void calls and a distraction may sound attractive, but make it a habit to sit with the blankness in you. Get comfortable with it.

Be wary of your overindulgences. Don't resort to overeating, snacking, sleeping or excessive video games. And if you do fall for it, at least train a keen awareness of it. Catch yourself.

Set very small goals. Open the book or pdf. Read a sentence. Do 1 question. Answer 1 text.
If you can't run, walk. If you can't walk, then crawl. If you can't crawl, then at least try.

Other than that, all I can say is you're not alone in this. Take care.""

"""""""To the OP of #NTUConfessions30158 (asking about Academic Termination), I am not sure if it is too late for me to give you a response now, but I would like to provide my own experience on Academic Termination. Do note that my experience does not represent that of other students who have faced this situation before and your mileage may vary.

I am in my final semester now and I experienced Academic Termination (AT) in June 2020. That was right after the semester where undergraduate students had """"free S/Us"""" due to the pandemic (AY 19/20 S2). I was in Academic Probation (AP) in that semester and was advised to selectively exercise the S/U option. However, I did not manage to pull my CGPA up to >= 2.00 and I received AT. My CGPA was very close to 2.00 and the difference was by a margin of a letter grade for a 3 AU module (i.e. D --> D+ or D+ --> C, etc.).

I believe that my decision to appeal against AT was majorly influenced by the phone call I had with my school's Pastoral Care Manager. (He had access to my Degree Audit so he could see not only my GPA, but also detailed information such as how many AUs I had earned and how many AUs I had left.) He advised me on what to include in my letter of appeal and he said that it was highly likely for me to be reinstated if I wrote a good appeal letter.

In conclusion, I feel that it is a good idea to speak with your school's Pastoral Care Manager or a staff from a similar department from your school. Perhaps he/she could provide you with advice that could help you get out of your dilemma."""""

"""Reply to #NTUConfessions30193

I entered NTU Engineering with A/CDD four years back, graduated with deans list (last AY), 2nd upper and got a well paying job despite COVID. Definitely not representative of everyone who came in with less than stellar grades, but what i'm trying to get at is that your grades don't define you as a person nor your capabilities on a whole. Your results in one system don't determine your achievements in another. Your past actions can't determine your future mindset.

I am certain that most objective readers will find your reasoning faulty, as it is too broad-stroked. It is obvious to most but I still found the need to sit down and type this out to provide an alt perspective. What do you mean by 'worse'? Worse in terms of our ability to attract students with good grades? Worse in terms of our teaching quality or reputation? Worse in terms of our curriculum?
We tend to assume the best of the grass on the other side, but I've had friends from other Unis telling me how our engineering curriculum is better in some regards (i still throw shade all day at most of the prof's teaching attitudes though).

One thing for sure is that #NTUConfessions30193 has shown the 'quality' of insights by one of our students. Making judgements based of an academically elitist benchmark and passing disparaging comments. I'm sure it does not reflect your morals and attitude towards others, and I sincerely hope that you may look inwards and recognise your prejudice. I have prejudices as well, we all do. However, putting those notions into words and actions materialises those negative views and this is even more harmful to yourself. Posting this anonymously on a public platform shows that you know the toxic nature of that confession.

Please rescind/edit your comments, or provide some clarification. I hope you really don't mean it in the superficial 'elitist' sense, or was in a wrong mindset when posting.

Stay safe ya.""

"""I cheated.
After entering my new work place for 6 months, I could hit it off really well with my colleague girl A and we started hanging out even after work. I was selfish, I wanted the best of both worlds, I didn't tell her that I am currently attached. We started going on dates and I was cheating emotionally. I had to find ways to hide it from my current girlfriend. After 3 months when things are getting serious, I cheated physically.

Day after day , my guilt is over consuming me, it wasn't fair for the both of them and I couldn't bring myself to tell either one the truth. My long time girlfriend thought that I'm always busy at work so that I couldn't meet her and she was very understanding, encouraging me along the way while in actual fact I was spending my day away at girl A's house.
Fast forward to last December when I couldn't take the guilt anymore and decided to end things with Girl A, she found out about my current relationship and threatened to expose it to my girlfriend. I didn't want my gf to find out from a third party so I told her myself.

She was completely broken. She went silent, she didn't ask me why, she didn't ask me what went wrong ,she didn't ask me anything. She just stared into space and sobbed silently. I promised her I will never do it again and seek forgiveness. I completely understand if she wish to leave me but she forgave me and she said she will be better for me.... I felt like shit. It wasn't even her.... the problem was me. She loved me with all her heart yet I took it for granted. She loved me so much that she blamed herself.

After this incident, we continued to live life together and explore new things but I knew things weren't the same. There are nights when I find her crying herself to sleep... I have ruined her perception of love and eroded the trust she has for me.....

"""In response to: #NTUConfessions30203

I'm sorry to hear you wasted 2 years of your life repeating your secondary school experience and environment but for an exam that doesn't hold any real value aside from getting you into uni. But here's some advice from a poly student who spent 3 years in an institution preparing them for the real world, preparing them with both industry-specific skillsets and real-life skills such as people management, networking skills, project management skills... The path to uni is skewed significantly in the favour of you JC brats. In order for us poly grads to get into a local uni, we pretty much require the equivalent of first class honours, but in terms of Poly cGPA. A poly 3.70/4.00 is equivalent to about 4.63/5.00 cGPA in NTU. What did we do? Suck it up and worked hard enough to qualify to apply for NTU. Maybe you're a freshie now, but when you see how hard it is not only to maintain your cGPA but to raise it past first class honours, then you'll start having some respect for your poly peers who worked equally hard, if not harder than you did to get into NTU/NUS/SMU etc, instead of whining that they're putting in less effort than you.

PS: if maybe, just maybe, you spent less time being bitter about other people and spent that amount of time toward improving yourself and your own studies, you wouldn't be in a position where you're whining because you think it's unfair people do better than you.

PPS: the maximum exemption for poly grads (apart from engineering direct Y2) is 12 AUs: 2 GERPEs, 2 UEs. which you can easily catch up either via MOOCs, which are also ungraded, or pre-Covid, overseas summer school. did you know NBS students from poly don't even get any exemptions?

1. as a poly student, and as mentioned by many fb commenters, we are exempted from mods because we alr took them in poly, not because we HAVE PRIVILEGE. rude of you to say we have same credentials but not the same effort when we had to work TWICE if not 10 TIMES as hard to get to where YOU are, and mind you, if that's your only definition of unfair while us poly kids not only have to deal with discrimination about not being SMART ENOUGH then sure! let's fucking trade places! i would love to complain about not being exempted from mods when i not only got to leave jc a year earlier than poly kids, but i also have it easier to enter uni and not have to stress myself up filling up my damned portfolio and cca achievements, while BALACING GPA at the same time! ://

2. instead of doing your damned homework and actually finding out the exact reason for this ""unfairness"" rather than writing stupid shit like this and discriminating us poly kids, how about you take the time to at least appreciate your poly friends who ""helped you so so much!!!"" instead of talking shit behind their backs? i have many jc friends but it's a jc kid like you that always ruins my perception of jc people when all i want to do is get along with them, as humans rather than because of our difference in backgrounds and grades.

"""Since year 1, I have been living in banyan hall 21b, a single room facing the basketball court. I have been living here for two years, but it have done irreversible mental damage on me.

I was a normal teen when I started living here, although my room is facing the basketball court, I was unbothered by the noise and cheering from the court. But since last year, I noticed my mental health is in a very unhealthy state. The damage is done little by little over time unnoticeably and by the time I noticed it was already too late.

Imagine u were studying comfortably in your room, then suddenly there is a loud cheering sound. Of course some would unbothered by it because this is just a normal background noise. This is how I think a year before. But imagine u hear the same cheering sound and the sound made by the bouncing ball every single day. Remember this sound. This is the sound that wake you up every morning, prevent u from sleeping every night. This is the sound that decide your sleeping schedule. This is the sound that decide your productivity in studying.

After two years living here, I have become a very sensitive person. I am sensitive to noise. I will be extremely bothered by a small noise even the sound of clicking mouse and tapping keyboard. Library is always my go to study spot, but now it is not. I have no place to study effectively. This create an anxiety add on to my existing noise-sensitive problem.

But things got worse. I noticed I get more violent and less emphatic. I would imagine dropping a grenade out of my window to the court full of people so I can finally be in peace. On the bus, I would imagine many other ways to murder a person who is talking and laughing loudly behind me. Imagining this kind of stuff is the only way to reduce my anxiety caused by noise.

Looking back, I am not the same person as I was when I started living here. Whose idea is it to build a basketball court right in front of student hostel?

++
I tried closing windows but still can hear noise and it is too hot in room. I also tried noise cancelling earphone and headphone (AirPod pro and Sony xm4) but still can hear noise. (maybe because this kind of stuff block white noise most effectively, but not human high pitch voice). I also tried wearing this while playing music but I can’t sleep when music is playing."""

"""Hello, I'm the one who submitted #NTUConfessions30203

I'm sorry. I.. really am. I didn't know anything about polytechnics' curriculum and assumed blindly. I wanted to seek some educating on this subject because.. i dont really have many friends from poly, not any that Im close enough to know how to ask my question without offending or potentially hurting.

I want to thank all of you who opened my mind about poly curricula and made me realise that JC, Poly, IB, or any pre-u education is hard in their own right.

I'm sorry if my use of language offended you as well. It's how I usually talk irl and in texting and I thought it would keep things light and informal.

I'm sorry for not researching a little by myself because I wanted to have the easy way out and get real answers from people who actually experience it. Now I know why there is an exemption and that there IS a good reason for it.

That's all I am truly sorry for. I have never discriminated, or rather, never intended to discriminate against the people whom I know are from poly. I admire their presentation skills and their confidence in public speaking that they inspired me to work on it. The people I worked with were smart, responsible, and always on the ball and willing to meet at any possible time over zooms and the like. I appreciate them whole-heartedly and made sure to do my best in honour of their efforts and they know that too and appreciate me for it as well.

Once again, I'm really sorry for hurting so many of you with my words and insensitivity. I sought for education, and whilst it was delivered in incredibly mean and unforgiving ways, I understand why it was that way and I am thankful that you still bothered to teach me about this subject. I hope you forgive me but it's alright if you don't as well.""

"""helloo, its been 3 weeks into the sem and i hope everyone is doing great so far. i wana share something which has been on my mind since last sem but have not done so yet.

Basically is just about dabao (or takeaway food in NTU). after circuit breaker and the start of sem 1, last sem NTU reopened the campus spaces with lots of additional safety distancing measures complying with the gov rules. the tables were moved out from the canteen to other spaces around northspine main area. it really helped in reducing crowding in the NS canteen especially during lunch time.

However because the tables are now spread out everywhere outside the NS canteen, more people have higher tendency to daobao or takeaway their meal *even when they are just bringing their food to eat at the tables outside of the canteen*. i have also seen people who would order eat-in and carry their trays out of the NS canteen to eat and then bring it all the way back later to the tray-return counter, which is very commendable. I once met a friend for lunch and we got a table outside that was outside the canteen. my friend later said that we can just dabao since there was no extra charge for the container (this was true for last sem and has stopped this starting this sem).

It broke my heart that people will just dabao for the sake of convenience (rather than carrying a tray) and convinced my friend not to takeaway cuz its just wasting the plastic for nothing. this sem, i see less of this dabaoing from NS canteen to outside tables (maybe cuz no more free daobao) which is pretty good. however, i still see some totally wasteful actions. for instance sometimes people order kfc and bring it out to the tables outside of kfc to eat. however they all asked for takeaway in plastic bags when they could just get it on a tray and carry it out. (ive seen others carrying their kfc trays out so i think is a possible option) also, i have been witnessing some very strange behaviour at my hall canteen. some people will ask for dabao and then just take their food to eat at the table *in our same canteen itself* ???? they are not even taking away the food to eat elsewhere, is literally eating in the canteen but asking for dabao.

The only reason i can think why they would do this is probably to avoid using the plate/bowl and cutlery used for eating in. because dabao means your food is packed in the container and u can get disposable cutlery. these people probably think that this is more hygienic (cuz now covid) to use disposables ... its not a 1 time thing and i see this every week at my hall canteen. although yes now is especially critical to ensure personal hygiene and stuff but i hope everyone who reads this can re-consider asking for a plastic bag or dabao, unless really needed. also, if you dabaoing from 1 place to another, and if its not too troublesome and your hands are free you can always decline the plastic bag to cut wastage. thanks :D""

I know it's not representative, but so far, the ones I have worked with/heard stories about, usually always everything like ""idk"", or like no opinion/sit on fence, never contribute much one, just follow others.

And usually they are the ones who complain the most about sch work, judge/gossip about other people the most.

The Poly girls on the other hand, woo, I have a 180 opinion. Of course, again not representative of all, but the ones I've worked with or know are SUPER driven, INDEPENDENT, and super chill and open about different topics. More down to earth and more humorous also.

"""Hello OP of #NTUConfessions30203. I myself am a former JC student. Although you may feel it is ""unfair"", it is really not. The typical path for a JC student from the start of JC to the end of Uni is 6 years (for a 4 year degree) which is no different from your poly friends who choose to do direct entry into year 2. Furthermore, the subject matter studied in JC and Poly are totally different. Poly can be treated as a lead-up to University, courses there are geared towards helping their graduates find a job once they obtain their diploma much like a degree. However, A-levels is more of a O-level sort of thing, its pretty good at getting you into your next stage of schooling and learning but useless in trying to secure a job. At the end of the day, employers are not interested in the amount of Organic Chemistry or Biology that you know but rather, industrial soft and hard skills, which is almost absent in a JC education and ironically, the basis of the polytechnic syllabus (doesn't that sound like University as well?).

So nope, it is not unfair at all its actually pretty fair in my opinion. In fact, you should be channeling all your learnt mugging skills from A-levels into making up for the ""extra"" mods that you are taking. And if you find yourself regretting taking these ""extra"" mods perhaps you should have better researched the difference between JC and Poly when you were sec 4.

Cheers and Happy Mugging""

"""There has been smth I'm quite upset about. Do people know that when you participate in FOP as a senior, like being a GL or a Proggie, etc, the school actually gives you a gift? I believe it was food vouchers or $10 starbucks card.

I'm someone who joined hall FOP recently, but I'm not from the halls so i didnt make much friends since i kept jumping halls. My first year participating and I did not even hear about the existence of the food vouchers. My second year particiapting there were gift cards. I dun stay hall so it was really inconvenient to collect the cards. And why is there a deadline to collect those cards? I did not know much people to ask to collect it on my behalf. Those i knew could not make it in time either.

My question is. These vouchers and gift cards are mostly sponsored right? Like in the end someone will spend them? Otherwise it would go to waste. But who? I see people from other halls using those vouchers. Why is it that my hall didnt get them? Or did we? And what does the school do with the extras? Why is there a deadline to collect these rewards when the school cant even meet our deadlines? Can't even settle complaints? Can't even fix STARS?

Ok sorry for the rant. Just... felt like this is unfair. The school shud have made online vouchers instead. Just send them to the students, right? Just a thought.""

"""In response to #NTUConfession30219

What an ""aggravated"" and emotional response. The language you used was so uncalled for, you told whoever you were targeting to stop discriminating poly students but you yourself are doing the exact same by discriminating JC kids. Honestly your response was pretty malicious imo and it shouldn't even have passed admins' approval.

Anyway the whole arguing is besides the point. This JC vs Poly stereotyping is actually very very rampant in our society. The typical JC ppl only know how to study, too sheltered, ""easily"" enter local uni, list goes on. And then there's also the poly ppl better at soft skills, slackers and less disciplined, whatever. But I have never agreed with any of these generalizations, they are so negative and they rarely actually apply to individuals, not for my friends around me at least. Each route has its own difficulties and merits, all humans have a good and bad side too but you do not need to use the institution they attended as a reason for an individual's demerits. There are so many other factors influencing a human's character so let us be a more gracious society okay? It is unnecessary to formed skewed perceptions, it does not benefit anyone!""

"""I met this guy in class and we started texting. We would text a lot, (to me this is really a lot because I am not an avid texter) and he started opening up to me about his more personal emotional issues? The text intervals were quite short, and So we texted every single day, for about 4-5 months. And he would always initiate/prolong conversations. It started becoming really strange because he didn’t ask me out proper during the hols at all.

And one day he “accidentally deleted” our conversation which is very typical of someone who is trying to hide something. The worst part was when I asked him if he was attached while we were talking about something else, and he didn’t give me a direct reply about that. Fast forward a month, my friend tells me she found out that he has a girlfriend??? So erm I’m finding this super shady and strange.. Normally, when i have guy friends who are attached, or am meeting new guys that are attached, I don’t even have to ask and they always somehow mention their girlfriend during conversations. So to me, I dont understand how he can go texting me for days on end without ever mentioning his girlfriend, and even when I asked he didn’t give me a clear answer. He also did stuff for me that were abit excessive (can’t really get too much into detail here). Its almost like I got manipulated into thinking hes free and avail and that im not overstepping my boundaries.

Don’t know if I’m being overly sensitive here. To be honest I feel abit played/betrayed and kinda angry because I almost invested myself into him emotionally and started to like him abit until I felt like there were a few red flags. Hypothesis is that he just wanted some attention from something ‘new and shiny’ lol. Makes me feel fking disgusted and dirty. Thoughts? Shld I create a revenge plot lol""

It was puppy love in secondary school, but I still feel like I’m attracted to him. We broke up abruptly, he didn’t offer no explanation, just blocked me everywhere. I guess his last straw was when I got jealous of him for liking a celebrity (I mean come on I was young and immature). 8 years is a long time, we both would have changed a lot, went through many milestones without each other.

Of course the administration is not flawless and still has a lot of issues, but such entitled little rotten deformed fruits are just making it seem like every admin issue is just the students' entitlement at fault.""

"Hey readers :) how has everyone been for the past year since the world caught on fire?

As some of you know, I strongly advocate for mental health and emotional intelligence and I saw this video when I was at work so here you go:

"""Disgusting. Utterly disgusting. Today at crespion cai fan, 2 birds flew near the sunny side up eggs and possibly ate it. The uncle quickly shooed it away. (I didn’t actually see the bird eating the egg but it was VERY VERY near it) The uncle was visibly upset and he inspected the eggs to see if they were clean. After a quick 2 sec inspection, the uncle decided to just leave the eggs there!? Come on, couldn’t he have just threw the 5 eggs away so that students wouldn’t have a stomach ache?!!!? And the worst part was that he continued to leave the eggs at the same very convenient spot at the top of the glass display for the birds to eat! Another bird flew there just as I was about to leave crespion. So 2 birds possibly feasted on cai fan stall’s eggs and now fellow students will possibly feast on bird germs.""

"""Hi hi, this is a post regarding postgraduate studies in NTU, hopefully some kind souls who have had experience with the PhD programmes in NTU can help shed some light on certain matters, TIA! I remember there was an info-sharing session last oct/nov(?) by a postgraduate from College of Science (I forgot the exact department, but i think it was Chem?) encouraging year 4s to sign up for the NPGS scholarships for their PhD programmes. I also heard from my friends at that time that there were quite some NPGS scholarships to be given out, although I'm not sure how true that was. Personally felt that the info-session was pretty detailed and the profs were really welcoming (and nice) and so I signed up for that particular scholarship. Interview results aren't out yet but I just want to ask some questions regarding that particular scholarship so in the event I do get the offer, I can make an informed choice as to whether I should take it (i know that scholarship is competitive and prestigious but let's just put that aside first). I guess I'll just list the questions below and if anyone has any idea about them, please don't hesitate to share!

1. Do students get to choose their supervisor? I mean we wrote a detailed research proposal before we even applied for the scholarship/programme. Is it possible that the school decides to change your supervisor without seeking your opinions before the commencement of the programme? How fair and transparent is this process?
2. I also heard from the postgrads who worked as TAs that they had to clear a certain number of teaching hours? What exactly is this teaching duty(?) and how much hours do I have to clock? Is there training for this because I'm not sure if I can deliver content to the undergrads.
3. As for the incentives, are conference fees subsidised by the school and do we get paid extra for any excess duties we do?
4. Let's say I have to quit the programme due to some special circumstances, will I have to return the amount paid from that scholarship since day 1 of the programme. Have there been any cases where quitting was not an option?

That's about it, please feel free to share more just in case I missed out some important questions in this post, thanks!!"

"""Outbound summer programs for GEM discoverer has been cancelled for AY2020-2021. How come there isn't an official email announcing this?

Even with the Gem iFair, there were still no updates and then came Feb. I had to keep asking because ntu simply lacked accountability. Just be transparent that the school is indecisive and unsure about whether applications will be open?

I wonder if it is difficult to find job in these two sectors. If I knew it is so hard to find a job with biological science degree earlier, I would have studied nursing instead. At least there is high job security, even though the job is very demanding.

"""To #NTUConfessions30252,

Y4S2 student here. Thought I was ""okay"" with settling for my third choice which NTU posted me based on my incomplete poly results (because we have to apply early, because #poly) - my final poly GPA was good enough to qualify for both my first and second choice (because final year 4.0 lol), but turned out to really have zero passion for my course and finally at the end of the tunnel, so you are exactly in the same boat as me.

I also thought of transferring but decided against it as, similar to you, it was too late and I was surprisingly doing okay in terms of results in Year 1, so I didn't want to risk transferring into my first two choices and screwing up my GPA. I instead did apply to transfer to NUS and was willing to restart from Year 1 but was rejected by NUS for reasons I would never know. Few things to try and keep your sanity:

1) Don't push yourself too hard. My current results still sit within the second upper range and I honestly could not have asked for more, given how disinterested I am in the course. I know I could have gotten better results I had studied just a bit harder and earlier, but a part of me really does not want to touch my lecture notes until I have to. I know if I have forced myself to sit down and study harder, I would really lose it by the end of the semester (and was close to a few times), so just try your best within your limits and that is enough.

2) Take up interesting GERPEs and UEs. Unlike many of my friends, I didn't choose to minor or have a second major. I spent my GERPEs and UEs taking modules that interest me and had a lot of fun. These modules were a breather every week and gave me something to look forward to. NIE has lots of interesting and fun modules that you can take (and SU if you want) but I find myself doing well enough, simply because I was truly enjoying myself and was genuinely interested in what I was learning.

3) Try to take modules within your course that you are ""okay"" with, if you have a choice. Based on my experience with the core modules, I took Major-PE modules I knew I wouldn't sink as much and had some remote form of interest in (like, maybe 5%) and it made things a lot easier, even if I still don't see the value in what I am learning. Don't take mods just because all your friends are taking it if you know you are not going to like it/survive in it - there were a few times I just took the module without knowing anyone else taking the same module, and all of them worked out fine (and I had new friends)!

4) Keeping this for the last, but once Covid clears and when travels are finally a thing again, hopefully before you graduate, go on semester AND summer exchange. I am thankful to have the privilege to go for both and it was a great way to clear modules. And no, I didn't just play, but took the classes seriously as well as they were way more interesting than my modules back in NTU and yes, did well even on exchange. I learnt so much on exchange even though people talk about the play part of it and it really complemented my learning in NTU as I was able to branch out to topics and issues I would never get to learn in NTU.

All the best mate; stay calm, stay sane - and good luck!""

"""Tldr; I have grown to disrespect and resent people who don't reply to texts

I don't know when this started. It was when I first started my first year as an undergrad when I first started texting people as a means to socialise in some way. And 99% of the time, people just leave me on read. While it wasn't particularly triggering to me back then, it felt like a sign that I should have placed more effort into texting as I figured I may have accidentally killed the conversation in someway. But yet time and again, people kept ghosting me and I felt inadequate. Eventually I may have gotten the impression that maybe just nobody likes me.

I started to withdraw from my own clique, I felt socially left out and uninterested in trying to socialise with my mates. I started to observe their actions. I noticed that they often used they phones and texted often right in front of my eyes. I wondered to myself, why are the people I routinely texted and ghosted consistently that claimed that they were always so ""busy"" or that they had ""nothing to reply"" with so busy on their phones?

This problem eventually got to my head and I felt really resentful. I feel so triggered whenever people just leave me on read and as much as I need to give people the benefit of the doubt, just how can I close my eyes to such injustice done to myself? Am I being egotistical for expecting such things?

I agree that I should not have let this define who I'm supposed to be and I'm trying ways to cope with this. But it's really depressing at times to just see my own efforts just go to waste. And even when I talk to someone new and I experience something similar to what happened, I feel instinctively really repulsive of people. And this semester, I need to work with those people that often ghost me and it's taking a toll on my mental health. What should I do? I am so resentful and I feel so powerless."

Also, ultimately he is my husband and I don't want him to be seen in a bad light as he is actually a nice person. But we're not really compatible and don't have any similar interests or values. I've never been in a relationship before as well and just feel scared. I really hope I am overthinking things.

Praying that what I feel now is temporary and this is just the awkward part in the beginning where we get to know each other. But a little part of me is just scared because there's a difference between finding someone nice and actually loving them. I want to love him and live a life that every girl has dreamt of about their marriage. Hope things work out, fingers crossed"

"""So 4 weeks after starting my internship, I had sex with senior employee.

Since I started working here, she was the first person to talk to me, show me around office and to make sure I adapt to this new working environment. She made me sit besides her in office and very often, we have been going out to have lunch together. To be honest, I have been regarding her as a Motherly figure because it's the first time somebody cared for me that much since months (I'm an international student, away from my family for more than a year).

Last week at lunch time, she called me and quickly mentionned to me that she's at the staircase and that she's waiting. To be honest at that moment, I had a feeling of what was going to happen. I was not sure. I was confused. When I was finally there, she came near to me, held my hand, kissed me and things became dirty. I lost my virginity to an aged woman (in her 50's)!

The most shocking part was when I learnt from her facebook profile that she is married and a mother of two. I am feeling very guilty and perturbed by what happened. I want to end this illicit and destructive relationship with her. I don't want to ever even talk to her again. If only I could leave this job...Today, I sat besides her again at office and she was like.. nothing happened.

I am sick of myself. The whole weekend, I kept thinking and regretting about this. How do I deal with this situation?"

"""This is a reply to post #30260 from the perspective of an ex-postgraduate student in the department of Chemistry in SPMS.

1. Your PhD supervisor can be changed by the school without first seeking your consent even when you had previously indicated your preferred supervisor. This has been done secretly behind the scene and there was no notice given to the affected students. The affected students will have to fight for their own rights in these situations.
2. GAP hours have been increasing in CBC due to a lack of TAs (which again is due to a lack of fundings). CBC has an internal rule that states you have to clear 120hrs of duties before your QE in the 15th month. This rule is unspoken and at least 4 batches of students had been tricked. A briefing was held in 2019 by a professor, warning current postgraduates not to discourage prospective studens from persuing a postgraduate degree in CBC. The current hours for a non-NPGS student is 208h after QE and 312h after QE for a NPGS student. For the latter, if you are not willing to perform the extra duty (50% extra hours), you may lose the extra $500 incentive awarded to NPGS students.
3. 4k/year, works on a reimbursement basis.
4. The school will try its best to prevent any NPGS students from dropping out of the program as this adversely affects their KPI even though it is stated in the contract that you have the rights to quit as long as the financial loss incurred by the school is borne by the student.

Situation in Chem was bad when I graduated, not too sure how it is now but make sure you ask around before signing the deal, if not you will find yourself in a deep pool full of lies, politics and unfair treatment! Know your rights and keep yourself protected, cheers."

"""TLDR: this is a rant about MA2005.

MA2005, one of the most, if not the most, outdated mod in MAE. it is a engineering drafting module meant to prepare the students for drafting work in the industry. Except that it doesn't. In this module, we learn manual drafting and solidworks. However, our exam and CAs, 75% of grade, is based on manual drafting. Manual drafting has been slowly outphased with the introduction of AutoCAD in 1982, that's right, fking 1982, the year before Star wars ep6 came out. The year when boomers were my age. know whats the best part? even AutoCAD itself is slowly being outphased since 2010s. I cannot think of a single company in Singapore who is still using manual drafting. When i was searching for internships last semester, no one absolutely no one , not even their ancestors, has manual drafting as a requirement/prefered skill. Even AutoCAD was not mentioned. They specified a CAD software like solidworks, fusion360, etc. I honestly do not know why no one noticed that MA2005 is in need of a thorough review."""

"""Just want to add on to the previous post #30260 by the OP regarding postgrad progs in a certain department in the university.

Regarding the postgraduate conference fees, it used to be $2-3000 for the entire candidature for a non-NPGS student but this value was slashed to $1500 and then again to a measly $500 in a particular financial year. Things might be different elsewhere but $500 is indeed insufficient an amount to cover for a conference trip. Just imagine struggling to pay for the conference fees, poster printing fees, flights, accomodation, daily allowances and transport connections with just $500.

If you think money and benefits are the reasons why students are unhappy with the school, you could not be more wrong. The real problem is not only a multifaceted and an entrenched one but also one of a repugnant nature. The practice of indiscriminately effecting changes in policies (with issues pertaining to the teaching hours and reduction of conference subsidies being two of the most contentious issues faced) across the board, affecting students regardless of their study year without prior consideration of how these abrupt plans could potentially affect them, is unquestionably one that could be seen as an inadmissible act.

While it would have been a totally different matter altogether if the department had valued the views of the postgrads and held a meeting to gather the opinions of the students before rolling out the new plans, the department instead held a meeting with the cohort which was cleverly disguised as a talk (one in which opinions would be properly heard and concerns addressed, as expected by every attendee), an announcement, an official statement to notify the cohort that the decisions made were final and no further objections and disagreements would be entertained. And yes, this occurred only after students expressed concerns over certain matters.

The lack of a direct feedback channel that serves as a means of communication between postgrads and the higher-ups, one that bypasses the immediate authority which till date still does not earn the trust of the student cohort, also further impedes improvements to the welfare of students in this department as a whole.

Through incidents like these, one could not help but to gradually realise the egregious nature of the management team in charge of the postgrads. While I understand that changes are inevitable in order to maintain competitiveness and stay relevant to the evolving society, forcefully imposing new rules which may be detrimental to the well being of the students as a hasty remedy is nothing but apathetic and contemptible.

Postgrads are human beings and they deserve basic respect and have their voices heard and opinions recognised just like every other professor, non-teaching staff and undergraduate in this university. This is a university, not a place where inequitable decisions go unchecked and imperious acts get condoned.""

"""Actually I have been observing these two colleagues and I really suspect their relationship is more than just friend/working relationship. I really want to share my observation with someone else, but I don't want to gossip with people in my real life. So I have these two colleagues and they are very close to each other.

The girl actually has a boyfriend who is still studying in NTU. Nonetheless, her conversation with me is always about this male ex-colleague who has very nice personality. I also observed that she is always very excited when talking about this guy and how good he is in term of his work and character. For example, she would say he is very caring, very fatherly and gentlemen.

She praised him so much to the extent that I really think she is into this guy. And, she said he consoled and comforted her when she was very stressed out/ sad last time. When she praised him, I would just nod my head and agree to her since this would be easier to continue the conversation. I really think that she likes him a lot when she said she went out with him alone during our block leave and the guy wanted to send her home. I am like OMG. I am super shocked when she told me this.

Until now, she still texts this male colleague very often and she likes to show me their conversation on WhatsApp. I really suspect that their relationship is more than friendship, even though she kept saying that they are just friends and she sees him as an older brother.

Anyway I just observed their interaction and I don't know why I just happened to feel and think a lot. When this guy was still around, he liked to talk to her on an one-to-one basis a lot. Even when I was chatting with her, he wanted to join in and merely talked to her. There was this one occasion last time before the guy left the company. He complained to me that the girl's boyfriend is very possessive and he doesn't like guys talking to his girlfriend. Anyway he described the incident that the boyfriend was being very unfriendly to him when he came to fetch the girl.

I really don't want to think about my current and ex colleagues in this way. However, I have a habit of observing people and I tend to interpret a lot when I am observing them. This is really the conclusion that I have derived. I saw her boyfriend a few times already. Even though he is quite young, he really made the effort to come and fetch her every day after work. I really admire his effort when he is actually staying quite far away from our workplace.

Anyway just to share over here, so that I won't have to keep this inside my mind over CNY.""

"""About 30 minutes ago, I just tried to hang myself. I had stepped off the chair but as I was suffocating, I realized that I am not ready to die yet. So here I am. Still alive. But, I can't seem to get rid of all the negative thoughts. These ""demons"" are running amok, they just pop up and whisper at me for being so useless, so pathetic. So useless for not being able to even take my own life. I am clearly a weak person. I have been contemplating suicide for almost a decade now, and I had attempted it before only to fail and be mocked by my family for wanting to seek attention. Till today, they'd still make jokes about it, sometimes because a drama scene on TV showed about suicide. They think it's funny. It isn't. I stopped watching TV with them. I stopped going out with them. It hurts. I learned to hide my emotions.

My family never cared about me, all they ever cared about was money and that's all they only still care about. They aren't rich but they are terrible with money. They aren't poor either. When I am feeling low, and they noticed, but they would never ask what's wrong, what happened, how are you. Is it so difficult? It must be, for them. It hurts their pride. It's funny because when I called SOS, they'd say, ""think about the loved ones you would leave behind"". SOS calls them ""Suicide Survivors"" and apparently, they have a higher risk of killing themselves too. A part of me wants to live just so I could become successful and make it the biggest fuck-you to my family and all the people who had despised me and mocked at me. Yet, a part of me just yearns to die because if my death could hurt them, maybe it isn't so bad, is it? Then again, they never cared when I lived, why would they care when I died? When I called SOS, the person at the end told me, ""baby steps"", ""take baby steps"". I had taken baby steps, yet, I am still alone. I am falling so behind in studies and I have nobody to turn to for help. My relationship with my family is a total wreck. I used to be passionate about the things I do, but I don't know why, I have lost all my confidence and all my passion. I am so tired with all b.s. and hypocrisy in uni. I had tried everything. I have tried everything I could. To fit in, to study harder, but nothing is working? If I were to die today, I just want to say, I didn't just give up. I had tried and tried, again and again, and I failed, again and again.

I want to stop feeling like this but I don't know how. I want stop thinking about killing myself. I want all these negative thoughts to go away. I want to be happy. But I don't know how. I wish I could seek for help but I know IMH is a dead fucking end with everything going digital. I can't afford private psychiatrist. My next appointment with my counselor is 3 weeks away. fuck. Please, someone just give me some advice on how to live on. What the fuck do I do""

"""Sharing this here because it's not being covered by the mainstream media. Copied from https://www.reddit.com/…/rant_an_update_to_transgender_dis…/

Hey, this is Ashlee, and I was the original poster of the other reddit thread. [https://www.reddit.com/…/rant_transgender_discrimination_i…/]

To avoid breaking the subreddit's rules, I will avoid revealing specific identities of people involved. I understand that some students may be in a similar situation to mine, being a trans student, but who is still closeted in an MOE school. I hope this thread, doubling as a rant, serves as a reference of the discrimination I have experienced as a result of having a proper medical diagnosis from a qualified doctor. I would like to offer my side of the story.

Over the past few weeks, my parents and I have met with the school's administration a few times. While MOE and the school has continuously said that they would 'work with me', their overall inconsistency, intentional disregard for proper medical advice and discrimination is showing to me - I have not received the level of support I had hoped for.

Going by the doctor's official memo [https://i.imgur.com/3qZ6bOf.png] from last year, the MOE, through their Facebook post [https://i.imgur.com/8WcQGMB.png], started off by blatantly misgendering me, outright disregarding and throwing aside my doctor's official memo from last year. Like the comments section suggests, this shows little interest in protecting transgender people against discrimination or acknowledgement of the medical community's professional advice.

This suggests that the 'we are against discrimination' message they put up is a farce, and although they claim that they 'work closely with and respect the professional advice', I do not see it myself. MOE publicly encouraged me to speak to the school's administration about this issue, which I have explicitly stated that I have done so for a long time. To me, it seems that they are trying to deny the existence of the meeting between MOE and the doctor, which happened around July-August last year, in which the MOE insisted that schools had to work with and consent before any referral or life-changing decisions was done - in addition to 'the family', and that the doctor was not to write memos for trans students to schools (family whom in my case already consented and planned to consent long before last year as soon as I turned 18).

Over the past several weeks after the post was made, the principal has insisted, in multiple meetings between me and the school's administration, that I had intended to 'crossdress in school' and it was not allowed. She justified it, saying 'there is no discrimination' and 'we have done a lot to support you'. The doctor's letter already states my diagnosis, and that I identify as female; cross-dressing is incorrect by definition, would in this sense not only be an ignorant, but a horribly discriminatory term, unless I was wearing the male uniform (i.e. dressing in boys' uniform as I identify as female; cross-dressers identify with their birth gender, but prefer clothing associated with the opposite gender).

She denies the existence of any form of discrimination while insisting that allowing me to use the wheelchair toilet was a lot; this is on top of another member of the administration misgendering me as I was sent out of the school compound earlier this year. The expulsion threats have changed: initially they said 'you will be expelled', 'you need to trim your hair', 'you are no longer allowed to return to school; you will have to either go to polytechnic or do private A-levels' (trimming in my case apparently meant cutting at least 4-5 inches of hair?)

As this case became public, they changed their tune to 'we will not expel you for being trans, and you will be allowed to do home-based learning'. However, last November, my request for home-based learning was denied on the grounds that it was not fair to other students. [https://i.imgur.com/gOPJQ4x.jpg] Recent meetings with one of the vice-principals said another reason: that 'they were overloaded and could not provide the resources for me' Interestingly, they did not mention of it being unfair to other students. How will they ensure that my home-based learning would always be available with such contradictions?

I offered to tie my hair up in accordance with the handbook's specified female dress code (and otherwise I would not have broken the rules at all), but it was denied by her. Instead, she changed the topic by giving the excuse of 'but females can have short hair too' - that 'hairstyle is a personal choice', but then the handbook only shows a girl with tied-up hair. She was also highly insistent on contacting my doctor for a timeline of the treatment (which may fall under doctor-patient confidentiality; not to be shared with third-parties, unless there are legal requirements to do so).

On the topic of discrimination in schools, in his speech yesterday, Minister Lawrence Wong stated that 'Where there are valid medical grounds, schools can exercise flexibility and work out practical arrangements for these students'.

Flexibility is good, but this version of 'flexibility' as far as I am concerned, means preventing me from going back to the classroom or lecture rooms even though I am physically able to do so, thus forcing me to do home-based learning if I want to express my gender identity as professionally diagnosed - whether it be through my dressing or 'obvious physiological changes that prevent you from fitting into the boys' uniform', no matter how well I pass as female or how many doctors' letters I hand over as the principal claims ('not even a doctor can change this' 'we don't exempt students from the dress code for injuries' 'I don't get your analogy about being exempted from the dress code due to a toe injury...').

My understanding is that this is essentially coercing my parents to encourage me to cut boys' hair, present as a boy and not consent to me starting hormone therapy or face the 'consequence' of losing my access to proper, fair meritocratic education, without any recourse for hands-on practice for science practicals with HBL (as I am a Science student), project work, or CCA, all of which is not only part of holistic education but also beneficial for university admissions in some cases (especially the more competitive courses).

If Mr Wong thinks that home-based learning is as good as physical classroom lessons, why have physical classes in the first place? I came to this school to study in the classroom environment with my friends; if I wanted to do HBL I'd sign up for online courses and do private A-levels instead. The principal claims that home-based learning is somehow a 'consequence', but 'not discrimination'.

Until now, this is my experience. I note that Mr Wong wishes to 'not import these culture wars into Singapore, or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society'. As far as I am concerned, my personal dressing conforms to the female dress code, and does not affect others in the classroom, let alone personally affect anyone's personal life. Had the MOE and the school respected my doctor's proper medical advice and scientific research, I believe this would have ended up very differently. You do not allow anti-maskers to go about without masking up due to the scientifically-accepted risks and dangers of Covid; why are you not just encouraging, but participating in discrimination at the expense of years of professional medical research? [https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/…/what-does-the-…/]

It is not about culture. It is about denying proper treatment, directly or indirectly, medical or in education or otherwise.

Why is the MOE contradicting and denying proper medical advice, treatment and quality education?

"""Hi Confessions Administrators, if you dont publish this, I will use other university confessions page to slam your comments.

Sometimes there is a need to put real facts right smack in the face of some commentators and NTU confessions administrator.

Do you realise that 99% of crimes against women, such as rape, molest, and peeping are committed by men and NOT men who present as women?

MTF transgenders and those passing as female are not in general interested in other women's body. Firstly, those on hormones do not think with the same head you normal men think with. Secondly, being interested in another women's body is equal to saying you yourself dont have those parts - its pretty psychological here.

Thirdly, some have done nullification - that is to say, removed the stupid head along with the disgusting jewels hanging there like pendulum. They do that because it is much more costly to get an abalone created. In the case of Singapore the legal gender marker can only be changed when you have created an abalone in the case of MTF and a banana for FTM.

Finally, some have created an abalone but choose to remain silent and keep their male gender marker due to job reasons. There is a lot of sexism in Singapore and women often do not get a well paid job like males do. So they do not disclose officially until maybe many more years down the road. I belong to this fourth category - male at work and female outside of work."
"""Seeing the GES just makes me pissed, CS jobs have been increasing in salary the past few years and most CS jobs these days pay 5k on average.

Obviously the average graduate from SCSE isn't as industry ready compared to other unis and it's no surprise when we spent most of our time learning things that are either irrelevant/useless/outdated because the school can't be assed to update the syllabus, literally just reusing the syllabus and projects from years ago and also the fact that they get defensive in the Student Feedback Survey when people tell them about it(???).

And to the girl with the golden/silver hair (sorry I don't recall clearly), wearing the blue checkered shirt, I thought you were really attractive :) Unfortunately, encounters such as this rarely ever materialise into a conversation or anything more - regrettably due to the culture here perhaps, where it's perceived as awkward for a stranger to approach another - so...here I am, expressing my sentiments with the unrealistic hope that she'll notice this...and maybe she might wanna prove me wrong, that missed connections like this one would never ever materialise into anything ;)""

"""Sorry long post ahead.

Looking at the GES stats makes me :(

I'm a trainee at one of the g agencies. The job is totally unrelated to my degree (or any other degree). Applied for it as the description seems manageable, mostly paper work. But in reality, it requires a lot of intersection with clients, n they are hard to please. Being an introvert doesn't help either. And for the admin work, I'm struggling everyday, there are too many things to know and none of the cases are exactly the same. Hence, I often hv to seek help n I feel really bad for pestering my colleagues since they alr very busy. I feel like a big burden but I also can't afford to tell clients the wrong things. I often spend my weekday nights n Sundays looking through cases, 看到要吐 (see until I want to puke). Friend in other traineeship said that I shldn't be doing so much since I'm only paid so little. But my clients are chasing aft me, how can I do less??

I've been thinking about resigning:

1. The pay is low, exactly 1k lesser than the mean Gross Monthly Salaey for my course, as stated in GES. I think I got more reasons to convince myself to stay if I'm getting the starting pay of perm staff. I feel underpaid since I'm now going through a process similar as those new perm staff, but they are paid 33% higher. Also, there's a shortage of manpower in my department. Checked with trainee of another dept, found out that my workload is double of his.

2. It doesn't spark joy at all. It's not always about money. When I was earning 1k monthly for interning at another agency, I volunteered to help out even on weekends because I really enjoyed working there, I didn't even claim my time off. (But the dept which I interned at won't hire directly so there's 0 chance of me working there as perm. )

3. Skills for this position is not very transferable. Can bs a bit abt communication skills but I really hate dealing with difficult clients, or people in general so I wouldn't want to focus on this in interviews.

4. I really feel like a big burden in the office. Struggling to cope with my cases and having to pester my colleagues (who are still nice enough to entertain my queries) make me very stress, I dread going to work everyday. I'm so sick of having to answer queries (which I myself have no answer to) and communicating with clients (I have many stories to tell but this might expose my identity so long story short, I've lost faith in humanity aft working here). Everytime when I thot I'm seeing light at the end of the tunnel, cases will suddenly flood in n the tunnel become longer lol. My eczema worsened in the past few months and I suspect it has got to with the job since emotional stress does trigger eczema.

This is a nice job to retire in if I'm a perm n I got a family to feed. It's iron rice bowl n salary can go quite high for senior positions, it's only a matter of time. But at this stage, given all the reasons mentioned, shld I stay till my 1yr contract is up?

If I survive the traineeship, they MIGHT offer me a perm position. I really hated this job but I'm really unsure what I can apply for as a humanities student. I'm ugly, don't have any special talent or specific interest n definitely not tech savy. I just do my best in tasks I'm assigned and worked super hard just to get a 2nd upper. I spent 4 mths applying for jobs aft grad n thot that I'll never get hired. I'm not sure if I should venture into uncertainty again. Looking at the GES stats, the market seems really bad, it will only worsen with the new batch of fresh grads joining and some not-so-fresh grads completing their traineeships/contract jobs.

If you're patient enough to read this post, any advice for this not-so-fresh-and-going-to-rot grad?? I'm really lost."
"""I’m here after reading Confession30358:

Even though it’s cliche, I really really wanted to say that you are not alone. Please try and talk to people around you because it will help. I am also struggling to stay afloat but it’s the constant encouragement and advice from others that keeps me from spiralling into that “I want to just leave” thought process. I am honestly still struggling, I’m literally doing worst in the thing I’m supposed to be specialising in, I’m in a very competitive faculty and as a very NOT competitive person it’s really so so taxing and makes me feel worthless and incompetent.

But just step back a bit. Look at your week properly. List down what exactly u need to do. Allocate time. And slowly do it. Take small steps and just do it. Recently, when I was happy about being able to do a super tiny LAMS quiz, someone casually told me “Small wins lead to bigger wins” and it has stuck to me and I keep thinking about it. Don’t worry about wanting to do well with first class honours and what not. Right now, just take a step at a time. I know it’s easy to say hard to do but it’s so important to change your mindset first in order for your body to agree and move on.

Before seeing your confession I literally just woke up from a (somewhat) nightmare where somebody berated me for not doing enough in uni despite them telling me to do so and I woke up at the verge of tears. There’s no universal “enough”, everyone works at their own pace. So as long as you’re moving forward, be it at a snail’s pace or a cheetah’s pace, you’re moving and that’s enough to me. Let’s keep going stranger!! All the best to you and everyone reading this who may be struggling in uni :) ❤️"

mi ish from NTU menagement. We (not I) know there a lot of concern on GEZ survey. Plz trust our menagement that we are doing our best to help (and to answer our stakeolder) that we can still entice more ppl to our sch.

Salary low is normal:
Plan: Our uni fees lower, so of course output lower la. What we suggist is that we should increase uni fees to match NUs fees, maybe even higher than NUs. More input = more output. Plz don't tell us our teaching methodlologies. We hire prof to do work, not teach. student normally very nice also, either no do teaching review/give 5 stars for those who did. they want fyp, better rate our prof up.

Industry exp:
Plan: we will make more internship oportunity (as phase 1). So stakeholers won't keep pressing us on enticing more ppl to our sch. Whether intermship ish relevant or not doesn't matter. Just get those companyes that in MRT, is say loud loud 1 in 10 got hear before to sign with us.

If 5 yer down da road still lower than NUs, then we will do phase 2 (you are our trial and we no need to pursue greatness next day anyway --> when me get to keep employment for next 5 years till i hop, then so long suckasss). Phase 2 then find the BIG companies to sign with us (can show progress phase 1 --> phase 2) to keep ma income.

Phase 3 we all dk how. Maybe work+study (2 day sch, 3 day at workplace). see how... need research impact

maybe we should sell our grad course more.. aloow more lab trials to take up, and widen FCH range so lesser ppl complain ish sch prob but more lack industry knowledge --> blame industry fast pace changing and we cannot keep up easier than blame ourz own tutors. smartz ppl not conplain, no one listen ~~"
"""In response to #NTUconfession30371

I have the opposite problem with my gf. She is very SOP-based person. When we first started our relationship, we had a conversation to lay out the expectations and what each party can/cannot do (basically the terms and conditions lah). I thought that was the only time we would do this. But no. Everytime I want the relationship to proceed further either emotionally (e.g by start to talk to her about more intimate issues or initiate more intimate physical touch) or in terms of our future (e.g. by mentioning BTO and stuff), she immediately detects it and asks me if we are ""leveling up"" and if yes, we will need to update the ""contracts"". Conversely, whenever she wants our relationship to ""level up"", she also mentions to me and again, update me about the terms and conditions. I ask her why she does not want things to flow naturally. She tells me she needs to get herself prepared emotionally and she can only do so knowing the full terms and conditions that both parties are in agreement with. Is there anything I can do or suggest her to do to improve our situation? Other than this, she is a really nice girl and I don't have any complain about our relationship."

1. Do you not get into a relationship with the intention of getting married?

2. If you do not are you just playing around?

3. You might still be figuring things out (together i would say) in a relationship. But if you live your life the same way as you used to without a bf/gf, then what’s the point of giving your partner a status? If you can do xyz even when you are attached, why not just call your bf/gf a “friend” instead, since there is no difference with or without the title.

4. I guess the commitment and “restrictions” that come with having a partner boils down to personal values, morals and principles. Your opinion may not be agreed with by the vast majority, but if you and your partner share the same values then go ahead and not be restricted by the bf/gf title."

"""I have graduated already, am currently working in a company. Still, I can’t forget that recruitment talk by an insurance company. At the career fair, I learnt from a VERY LOGICAL AND MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN formula that being an Insurance Agent offers better earnings potential than traditional jobs.

I still remember what they told us: “it’s a numbers game. For every 50 people you cold call, you get 1 appointment. For every 7 appointments, you close one case”. So the more you put in effort, the more people you prospect, the greater your earnings. I was also told “it’s REALLY a numbers game. Even if you are not good, then maybe for every 100 people you cold call, you get 1 appointment. Then never mind, just increase the base number.”

The law of large numbers really makes a lot of sense. I can’t find a logically sound way to disprove it. In addition, the recruitment talk told us “if you work as an auditor, no matter how hard you work, no matter what your performance is, you get be same fixed salary every month. Your hard work isn’t reflected in your salary. But as an agent, it’s really like the harder you work, the more you earn.” Which I can’t find any flaw either.

I also remember someone whispered “he’s making a lot of assumptions here”. I can feel that somethings not wrong here but I can’t put my finger on EXACTLY WHERE. What’s the”assumption” he’s making?

I chose an office job because I told my parents about this “maths proof” by the recruitment talk and they told me a circular argument: “don’t be an Insurance Agent because it’s not good. “ so I didn’t become an Insurance Agent because it’s “not good” and I chose an office job because it’s the “correct answer” but I realised that an office job is really fixed salary no matter what.

What’s really wrong with the Insurance Agent law of large numbers logic? What’s REALLY wrong with the “unlimited earnings potential” that they claimed? Someone please objectively shed some light on this issue. No rude comments and trolls please, thanks!"

After the process failed, she dint bother washing up. Me and my bf washed up. Mind you, i bought all the ingredients with my own money and i tried 3 times at his place because i wanted it to be a fun lil couple activity and also make some for his parents since its moon cake fest at that time. All 3 trials failed because his maid kept intervene and say this wrong that wrong. Then i just try making it once at home at succeeded (i like baking and my grandma taught me how to make mooncakes when i was little). And like the maid always leave dishes stacked in the sink for hours and not wash it until so theres always dirty dishes in the sink, which makes it hard for me to wash anything (the sink is really small so there will always be back splatter whenever i wash any utensil). I mean i have no qualms about washing his parent’s dishes but do i even have to clean up after the maid?

The only reason why the maid isnt fired is because she took care of his grandma for a long time and his grandma is now having dementia. So she got comfortable and like complacent. She literatelly dosent do any housework after 5pm so the dishes are stacked. Lol. And his parents are nice enough to buy her food for all meals. When she dosent like the food they bought, she just ask my bf to eat it for dinner or throw it away lol. Im not kidding. Back to the question, am i crazy for not wanting her to touch any of my things?"

"""What do you do if you know there’s a sociopath lurking on campus grounds, attending lessons with you all day? Should you report her to campus security? Yes, I know not all sociopaths are violent and enjoy bloodshed. But female sociopaths use poison to kill, instead of guns and weapons. And worse, they are good at pretending to be good people to cover up their lack of emotions inside. That’s what makes them dangerous.

I keep thinking of this particular girl who was a casual friend of mine while we studied in ntu. I spent a lot of time with her for 4 years and there’s something NOT RIGHT about her. I sometimes meet her for post work dinner and she’s still giving off that WEIRD AURA AND VIBE. Let me write down some concrete points.

1) she eats one whole plate of rice, and another whole bowl of noodles, and another bubble tea for lunch and dinner all the time. I eat one serving i very full already but this person eats SO MUCH. It’s not one isolated incident, I observed her for 4 years and this is the amount she consistently eats all the time.

2) I got go toilet with her before and she never vomits. I know. I just don’t know where all the food went.

3) when she sits beside me, I can even hear her stomach growling when I sit 1 m away because her stomach is always hungry. There just isn’t any logical explanation for where her food all went.

4) she’s not putting on weight at all. I think her body mass index is 18 only??

5) she is also a virgin at this age. She never dated. She isn’t interested in dating and sex. She’s the only one among college age students who doesn’t masturbate. She never did before and she said it’s not fun(?) to do it. She told me she never got sexually aroused before.

6) when we were still in university, in 2015, she didn’t even shed a tear when LKY passed away. Everyone was bawling their eyes out at the funeral and all, but she said she doesn’t know him in person so she can’t cry for the death of someone she doesn’t know.

7) it’s not just National leaders, whenever we watch movies or documentaries or shows together, she never cries at the sad parts at all. She just doesn’t have the ability to feel love (as denoted from point 5, she can’t even get aroused and have sex) and feel sad about death and parting scenes.

She didn’t do any harm to anyone but there’s something not right. I didn’t call on her behaviour because I don’t have concrete evidence of her doing bad things. But what if you come across one such person in your life, will you let the authorities know so everyone can have their peace of mind knowing a sociopath isn’t on the loose?

"""Looking for some advice:

Earlier this year i saw this job posting for a part-time admin executive promising a $1k/month + OT salary with a job scope of
1) admin of customer details
2) training hours of 3 hrs/year
3) flexible working hours of 5-10 hrs/month

I thought, sounds pretty good, and sent in my details to be contacted. They didn't ask for CV/resume, so i should have guessed something wasn't quite right then. But i didn't.

A couple of weeks later, i get called by someone regarding my application. They asked some questions, including my current occupation (undergrad) and some other stuff. Nothing about previous work experience or such. We then made an appointment to chat and see if i was suitable for the role.

At the meet-up (at a shopping mall eatery), i'm told about a completely different job role, and such. I was convinced to sign a contract (i'm unsure if it is legally binding, as the form itself has many errors including an inaccurate company name that is misspelt several times) and had to paynow $250 out of the supposed $1k fees to take certification tests to be a financial advisor. Some of the job scope that was described to me included ""wiring excess money that customers give to my bank account to my supervisor's bank account""

after the meeting i had shared this with a friend and they advised me to back out asap, and try to get my money back. When i contacted the person again, they said that i had to refer someone else to ""take my spot"" otherwise they would not give me back my money as that is what i had signed in the contract.

"""This is in response to confession #NTUConfessions30449

I’m sorry dude but imma have to be blunt since I don’t know you. What you and your girlfriend of 3 years have now does not sound like a healthy relationship. A healthy relationship ought to be between two understanding partners who listens to each other. Her deliberately going against your struggles and refusing to listen is very telling on her lack of empathy towards the whole situation, and most importantly you.

As an adult who is ready to get married, she should have been able to realise that as an undergrad from a low income family, you are indefinitely broke and does not have the financial capacity yet to sustain a new marriage where money is the utmost importance.

Say if you are to marry her. The financial turmoil you WILL go through will only make you resent her even more down the road. The genesis of the marriage is already ugly. It is time to realise that she has a childish mentality when it comes to an adult decision of marriage.

My advice, is to cut the cord. The 3 years has been fun and educational for both of y’all, I’m sure. But sometimes we have to make the grown up decision to be selfish and know that it’s completely okay to put into importance our own mental health.

She can find another rich person who fits her financial goals while you can work on yourself. You are young and WILL find someone else in the future once you are financially capable. I’m sure of it. All the best my man. You got this."

"""With reference to #NTUConfessions30452, I hope new uni students do not get conned to become insurance agents in the future. Current insurance agents themselves often pay handsomely to many students upfront to recruit many to work under them to get a cut of their commission and increase their chance to get out of the sales role for a promotion to be a manager. Uni students are often the target because they know we deeply crave the social status of both promised wealth and some empty title. As far as I can tell, the industry is however at its last dying breath given the massly recruited agents fighting for a fixed (and shrinking) pie of the Singaporean population (in fact its shrinking, most has a policy by now), I think one has to think twice before jumping at this easy money.

"""Response to #NTUConfessions30454:

Dear Mr Tough Guy,

Being inconsiderate, whether intentional or not, shows a lack of manners and civic mindedness. When a fellow member of the school community takes to this forum to remind you to be considerate, the least you could do is take note of what he/she has said, and be more aware of how your actions could be affecting others. To act as though you are at no fault, and worse still, threaten the person who took the effort to remind you (probably on behalf of many others too), this just reflects on your values and upbringing, and puts your level of maturity in question.

I am generally a nice and easy-going person, but I do not like people with big egos. So I thought I should let you know how ridiculous your reply is.

No one in the right mind would want to waste their precious time meeting someone like you. Even myself, a person who likes cars, would meet you only if you drove a nice car but heck, you obviously can’t afford one anyway. And I can assure you that as a mixed martial arts practitioner, the last thing that would cross my mind is being afraid to meet you. So be more humble. While you may not have had to chance to learn the importance of consideration for others as a child or teenager, it is never too late to start. In fact, you can start by not revving your engine at the SRC Carpark.

So to Mr Tough Guy, I empathize with you, and wish you all the best in your learning journey. Cheers!"

I work in tuition center. And, now the students' grade are coming back. The KPI of the job is the students' grade and this makes me feel really stressful and unable to sleep well recently.

i'm also a tutor in a tuition centre and this is my 3rd year there, so i can fully relate to your concerns. honestly, i am suffering from a mental illness and i consult my psychiatrist monthly. so really, i do understand the stresses that you face. i think the most important thing for us tutors is to evaluate our values, and the implications that our words bring when we educate the kids. believe it or not, our words will have an influence in the way they think, and we can bring about that change with positive reinforcement.

personally, i don't think rewarding kids with money is a good thing. a certificate or a sticker will make their day as well. we place so much importance on working hard, doing homework, achieving good grades. but the thing is they're just kids, they're still learning and growing, we all are. at some point in anyone's lives, they'll go through a difficult time. just like how my O level score was pretty trash but i ended up in NTU anyway. what's most important is the attitude, moral and mindset that they adopt in their teenage years.

making mistakes, failing exams, skipping school - these are perfectly normal. many try to help their kids achieve ""perfection"", but this sort of perfection brings about more harm than good. they will not learn to deal with failure, and they don't know that ""it's ok to fail, i will try again"". and that, to me, is really disappointing.

you may want to reconsider what kind of values you want to impart to your students. if the centre does not share the same value as you do, you can consider going freelance, or even take a break from tuition. it may help you view the situation from a wider perspective.

all the best :)"

"""There is this module that I'm taking which I don't think the professor likes me a lot. Every time I raise, she would either question me heavily about it which she doesn't to other students even if they raise a trivial point or make a point that is out of context. It could be that my point is out of context as well, but the thing is, yesterday I made a point that is similar to another student's, however she did not grind the other student, but for me, she heavily question the point I raised which is actually similar.

I shall give a slightly clearer context in the scenario: so basically, she was asking about what are some of the possible ways to reduce people stealing from various places in Singapore. So we are supposed to discuss with the people sitting around us, and after that share our answers. There is this student who mentioned that maybe making the screen of the CCTV visible so they will be more self-aware and feel more shameful if they steal. And the prof says it's a good point. My friend and I discussed a similar point of having more mirrors in the facility, which I thought was similar to their point (and maybe also a cheaper alternative) and so I raised it up - stating that we also have a similar point. But then she further ask me to elaborate further, asking me where I can place in the mirrors in the facility (she didn't ask this to the previous person), why would I do that and think it would work, and further ask me to be even more specific when I said the particular locations it could be installed and the additional reasons for the use of mirrors (in addition to my initial point of how it is similar to the previous person's suggestion).

It makes it very uncomfortable for me sometimes, because it actually happens almost every time I speak and this module has a 20% class part so she does want people to speak out in the lectures, but maybe except for me. I haven't have this problem with my other modules before, and it is really quite disheartening. I have been spending some time planning on what I want to write the final report, but somehow, I feel that the effort I will spend on writing that 10 pages will be futile.

But after that, it feels terrible, because you aren't around anymore. Well, its kind of my fault for falling for you. But when you said that we could remain friends even after, you really were the best thing that happened to me in school. But after that, why did you have to leave in such a manner :/

Tell the entire incident, including my side of the story to any of your more rational friends, they wouldn't agree with you. It sucks and it hurts. I'm really not trying to win an argument or anything, but i just really want to understand why, if you really wanted to not be my friend anymore, why did you have to wait for a moment like this?

I am too overwhelmed not just with the job but with the people too. I feel scared and don't know who are the good and evil people in the workplace.

I started cutting, biting myself, scratching my skins and even slap myself because i think this is my punishment for not being good enough for them.

Take our cz2006 and cz3002 as an example, I felt that these courses are more about project management rather than software engineering. And also, these 2 courses felt more like a small simulation of us working in a company. Not sure if SCSE designed it this way, but cmon, isnt foundation more impt?

"""Hi guys, a ME undergraduate here. I really some form of advice. I know I might have posted some time before, but I need some advice. I feel like this may be a safe place for me to ask for advice so please do not try to identify me at all. How do you guys overcome your low gpa? Were you guys able to manage a good job after graduation? My current gpa (semester 4) is around 2.5 and I know it will be impossible for me to even push to 3, meaning to say I might only be able to graduate with a pass degree. I feel like I have made the wrong choice of studying in a university or even studying in NTU. I feel like I had made a wrong move and shouldn’t have accepted the offer letter in the first place. Instead, I should have just joined the workforce after completing my A-levels but my pay would be substantially lower. I was not from a bright school either so I am not that bright of a student.

I have endured many struggles in my life. I came from a very financially challenged position. This is my family composition. My dad died when I was much younger, and my mum is terminally ill. Currently, my brother is the sole breadwinner and the income earned from my brother is around $3000 and this is used to cover expenses (bills, groceries, medical) and therefore there I do not receive any money from him. When I entered NTU, I was only had around $2000-$3000, of which I had saved during my army time. Currently I am funding myself 100%. I have applied for many bursaries to defray my living expenses, school fees and any expenses I can incur such as purchasing items, clothes and any other forms of payment. I had to work part-time during weekends, and I had to manage with my household chores (house cleaning, washing of my own clothes, going to the market occasionally to help my mother). The only way I could ever eat in school was to bring my own food packed by my mum. I cannot afford to buy food in school. Since my brother is moving to a new house by this May, I would have to find another way to offset the family expenses.
I have initially thought of taking hall to understand the pace of school when I first join
ed but I could not afford it. While I stay somewhere near in the central (somewhere near Tanjong Pagar) and while it may seem relatively near, I thought of doing part-time work to offset the hall fees.

Many a times, I wish that life was not so struggling. When I see my friends with better gpa, it becomes so disheartening. When I hear that they graduate with FCH, second-upper, second-lower, I would be consumed with guilt. I had tried my best but apparently, it is not good enough. I do hope you guys can offer me some good advice. I have tried to go for counselling but it really worries me at this juncture that I would be rejected of future employment due to my bad gpa. Upon graduation, I have to pay off remaining school loans, bear for my mother’s medical fees and the household expenses and many more. Due to my hectic lifestyle, I was not able to join any other kinds of commitment (CCAs, volunteering) and my current resume is rather empty.

I know that this may be too far off and I have some time before graduation but the expenses I am currently responsible of is rather overwhelming. Please give me some good advice and I am all ears.""

"Actually to be clear, if you are in a public place, a photo taken of you does not constitute a breach of the PDPA act. In fact, when photographers ask people ""Can I take a photo of you?"", it is actually out of courtesy. Legally, they can take a photo of you even if you say ""no"". Somewhat tired of people fraudulently misrepresenting the law.

It is not a breach if:
The person who took the photo had done so in their personal or domestic capacity, i.e. they were not taking the photo in the course of their employment with an organisation; and/or
You were in a public area generally open to the public. This is because personal data that is publicly available is not protected by the PDPA."
Never cover nose might as well dont wear

In fact, he dutifully carried out his duties despite being fully aware there are jerks like you who would insult and curse at him for doing what's best for everyone. How courageous of you to curse at the security guard who dutifully did his job, while hiding behind an anonymous post.

This is why the pandemic is still ongoing. Thanks to exceptionally brilliant individuals like you."

"Your points here aren't very compelling. Instead you should ask if your fellow classmates are actually able to assess what's a good essay and what's a bad essay? Are they provided with guidelines for how to score and/or examples of good/bad answers. 

Another point to raise is, would every student be given the opportunity to evaluate fellow students. If youre an F student, you probably couldn't tell the difference between a 'B' or 'A' answer.

Finally, we all know there are many clowns who struggle to complete their own assignments. Why shouldn't we expect some students to not bother with this assessment at all, just get through it without putting in any effort.

Faculty members are paid to do this. They can recruit and pay TAs to assist with marking. Getting undergrads to score each other is just lazy."

"Father-Mother and Son-Daughter kinship. You shall be on one side. To remind father or mother to side you at the right time.
| These times cousins-friends are there to hear you."
"Your mum shouldn't have burdened you with her problem with the husband and should strive to resolve it herself. But I think she lack the willpower and determination to really get a divorce because life will be uncertain. Where will she live and how can she support herself? So, when you moved out, I think she wished she could do the same but how about your sister?

I cannot advise if you should ignore your mother or choose to care for her - that's your decision. But it may be beneficial for the family to go through counselling, as what some people have suggested. :) all the best."
"Try to visit her and go out with her often, so that she won't feel so ""abandoned"" by you. I feel that you did nothing wrong by moving out. 

Often times, parents can burden their adult kids with their problems without realising it. And they may think that just because they are the parent, they have the right to burden their kids with their problems. 

Your mum may feel financially dependent on your father, so the prospect of divorce is very scary for her. Although she doesn't get along with your dad, at least he is still a familiar face to her. If she were to divorce him, she would be all alone in the world, so to speak, and I think that's what scares her.

I don't know how else to advise you. I hope that you are at least earning well and taking good care of your health. I hope everything works out well for you. Take care."
"I experienced the same issues and I feel exactly the same way as you. You did the right thing. Thankfully, for me, I managed to stay in hall so that was really good for me. But by then, I had already taken on the effects of their anger and unhappiness.  I still feel a lot of anger and frustration in me that was probably taken on subconsciously from my parents' negativity. 

You are not responsible for other people's happiness, especially if they know the root of the problem and do not act on it.  You need to heal and lead your own life. What you can do is to be supportive remotely. If you can, gently explain to her that living together will affect your mental health. 

another thing you can try (which i am trying myself) is - one ear in, the other ear out. You should not take on the burdens of others. So you can be empathetic, show concern and then let go of that. Much like a counsellor - they offer a listening ear, but they do not take on the problems of others. For me, personally, meditation helps too.  

Take care, OP. Hope things will get better."
"Hey you are not responsible for your parents lifes, and there is nothing wrong with being happy and prioritising yourself after moving out don't blame yourself too much. I guess your mom is kinda afraid of the changes that come with a divorce.
Hopefully someday something might inspire change in them and life will get better."
"I agree with grandma. Give yourself permission to create some emotional distance - you’re the daughter, not the mother.
Peace, space and quiet - not too much to ask for, as a working adult, right?  "

But if you have already tried your best (for a long time too), and you get nothing but negativities in return, then perhaps this issue is really out of your hands. May not be easy, but just carry on with your own life. You seem strong and independent, so do take care of yourself yeah? :)   "

I felt the exact same way when I just started out my PhD studies in NTU, especially during the first semester (it's practically a living hell 24/7, lol, even until today). In my case, the fear of being unable to surpass the accomplishments of my peers has been a key driving force for me to succeed in life."

"It is important to find a purpose such that it makes whatever you are doing in life much more enriching. The stuffs that you are doing now probably do not stimulate / give you that sense of purpose. You feel that you are meant for something greater and yet not know what. 

What I can suggest is to first set a direction. Find out what you really want to do in your life and the skills you want to build with the time that you have.

Next, you should find a routine, it can either be from a related career or from mixing around with kindred spirits. It is important, on top of having a motivation to do things, to have the constant external drive to apply what you're doing to see its impact.

"I think you have burnt out. Take a short break - relax,  reorganise your thoughts, plans and priorities - seems like you have too much on your plate right now.
It may look like many people do things out of motivation but there are also many people living day by day and following through the motion, seeking their direction in life. It's not always motivation, sometimes it's the fear of losing out; it's a natural survival instinct.
It's perfectly fine to feel lost at some points in life, it is also perfectly fine to speak up about it or even seek help. Whatever you do, don't give up, lose hope or the will to live."

"Don't give up, stay positive ."
"Good that you have persevered all the way in life. It sure wasnt easy growing up for you but then again never ever give up on your own life again whatever the circumstance - imagine this thought; you can never restart your life and there’s no turning back your actions ever again, but with your current capabilities now, you are now more than able to drive your life for the future.

My only advice to your questions is “Seize the most of everyday, aim to be a better version of yourself than yesterday. You are more than what you think you are!”
"
"This reminds me of someone. All I can say is, don't worry about 2 if you're not too picky 

1) Define good job. There are big companies that pays 800-900 and those that pays over 8k (monthly for internships), Both of which have very steep learning curve and drains your time like mad. If your sole purpose is to look after your mother only, chances are you don't need that high a salary (comparing to those that needs to take care of both parents, grandparents and even, spouse, etc). 

2) Don't worry. Keep fit, exercise. Healthy mind and body is the least you can put effort in to control. Others, leave it to fate and keep meeting new ppl :). It is hard to find someone who can truly appreciates for who you are these days. More often than not, both parties will have to make compromises. If one side stops, and a fresher and nicer third party comes along, it's time to say goodbye - whether you want it or not. 

3) Ive seen some introverts that tried to be as outgoing as possible during the final year in uni. Maybe for a start, stop labelling yourself as introvert. I don't know about you but imo, those that I've met who always labelled themselves as introvert are least likely to become outgoing. They kinda built a ""wall"" around themselves, kinda live in their own world.. I also recognize that sometimes, it could also be that there is no one that met your frequency/chemistry when it comes to the topics in discussion and that you could also be very outgoing with a few selected friends. What I can suggest is:
- Remove this introvert mindset when meeting new people, 
- Learn to offer a listening ear rather than expecting a listening ear. 

You have no idea how much life lessons/life decisions/motivations you can learnt if the other party is willing to open up. I think this scales with empathy. More empathy, easier to connect. 

I wish you all the best and hope that you can find your balance in life :)

"Answer to qns 1:- you can go for upgrading courses that is related to your degree? Apply some knowledge from the courses through hands on approach and apply them in your course of study? In my opinion, there’s no such thing as a good job in the market. I always tell myself that as much as I want a promotion and an increase in my pay, I just want to make sure I don’t have to worry about my next meal and not to worry about how and when to pay my bills.

Answer to qns 2:- mingle around with your course mates and get to know them better because one day you’ll need them and vice versa. Keep those that you can click well with in your inner social circle. As for finding a partner, perhaps start by talking to the opposite gender more and be more open about yourself rather than coop yourself. 

Answer to qns 3:- again back to qns 2 answer. You got to be more forthcoming because no one will make the first move till you do. All the best in your studies and good luck finding your potential partner. "

"I think the question should be how we solve this for both gender's toilets rather than normalising it based on the fact that both genders face that issue.

So I think that although there is unequivocally a differing balance on how ""at risk"" each gender is, the focus should still be on just resolving the matter as a whole. That is based on my outsider view and I do not have a proper or full understanding of NTU's toilet policies and perhaps, limitations regarding manpower and scheduling."

What agency is this? Normally tuition fees u can collect from parent directly rather than going thru agent. So is not normal. Reject the assignment from this agency
"You should be able to get a percentage of the tuition fees if the parent were to terminate the tuition before the completion of the first month. 
You are also not obliged to go over 30 minutes before to talk about the student — anything like that can be done digitally. 
Also I have never heard anything about paying 1 month’s worth of fees to the agency ...
All in all the agency sounds real dodgy, run asap"
"As others have said, better siam. Also, face to face tuition is a thing of the past. Now the trend is to record and sell your tuition videos on Udemy, Skillshare, sell your course work and *exclusive* assessment papers on OnlyFans, Patreon. For face to face, can do it via zoom and charge at premium rates of $80/hr and above.

If you do it good enough, the people at Masterclass might even invite you to teach ""Tuition"" on Masterclass.

P.S: If you need help with setting up a training account on Udemy, and don't mind paying a small fee of $20 (limited trial only), I know a guy who can set it up for you (except the videos which you have to record and the assessments which you need to provide. duh~)

"I think the agency is just protecting their co own interest and ""stepping"" on tutors since parents are their clients. Haha."
"Quite abit of red flags and potential legal headaches. I'd avoid committing my services to this company. If you have a bad feeling about this company, your hunches are probably right."
"Personally, I communicate to the parents that I prefer a monthly payment arrangement instead of every four lessons, makes things easier on you especially if the student tends to reschedule lessons. 

I avoid tuition agencies that insist on handling the fees after the initial month. It’s not fair for the tutor and it’s also not the norm. 

You should feel safe and comfortable in the environment that you teach in. Give it a lesson or two to gauge the environment, if it’s unbearable, you can stop the tutoring. But I believe that most agencies will not pay the tutor if you initiate to cancel. You can give the client a chance and teach for the first month in order to get paid. 

As for communication with tuition agencies, there  isn’t much you can do about it as they are the ones recommending you the job. The best you can do is to do your due diligence and work with one that is trustworthy. Of the top of my head, avoid Nanyang Academics!!! This agency is known to not pay the tutors their share of the fees when an assignment is canceled. 
The boss also has various agencies under various names.

Happy tutoring!"
"From my stint of freelance tutoring (2.5years for 2 students), the ""30min talk about student prior to tutoring"" only happens once every 1-2 months. This was just to give the parents a heads up on their progress and to ask questions about school work or anything that the parents want to focus on specifically. I did not care much about the payment as the parents were kind enough to treat me to bubble tea/snacks sometimes. If you really want to be paid, discuss that directly with your clients.

I also had my payment come every 4 weeks, paid from the company. It is cross-checked with the time you actually tutor the kid. No hiccups except for once where I thought my rates were supposed to be xyz/hour and not abc/hour.

I can't help with the additional clause bc it wasn't in the contract that I had with the company I liaised with.

One red flag would be when the agency coordinator you are tied to replies in very vague manners to your queries. It either shows that the company isn't sure about it or hiding something. Red flags about parents are very subjective. Something that I am ok with might not be ok wjth you, so go with your guts. "

"Believe me things will get better. Right now the emotions are the strongest so its normal to feel this way, try to take part in things you always liked (this is the hardest step of not letting ur mind go back to the past) after a while, the emotions will not be that strong anymore, and soon you'll feel nothing much when you think of her because you've moved on.
Just take it as this was meant to be, whether early/late, it'd have still happen and there was nothing you could do to change it - because it was her decision and not yours.  Even if she continued being with you (she wouldnt have been able to give you as much as you did for her) which ultimately hurts both parties. This was for the best.

Obviously CCA more important than Gpa 
internship
"Internship, companies rarely even ask for your GPA."
They look at who your father is. Its never what you know but who you know.
"My guess is GPA is important for first round of screening for most hr.

Whether internship is a priority depends on which role/ field. Industry in-demand skills are important. Skills can be gained to some extent thru self-study, if internship is not available. Depends on the competition for the role, I would think most employers expect to give on-job training when hiring freshgrad, so missing some skills may be ok but of course, meeting all requirements will give you an edge.

During interview, people skills are important.

Regardless, unless in public service or CCA has industry ties or high leadership position held, rarely CCA is important. Its relevance diminishes further for your second job, and so on.

If you know someone who is already in the company (e.g. thru internship) to recommend you, the chance is usually a lot higher."
"Depends on your field. In Engineering, they prefer hard skills (Internship, FYP) to GPA, CCA. But in sales or business fields, i think they prefer CCA, Volunteering ..."

Anyway, you should both tell your mum to stop comparing it, its not healthy and you both know you are doing your best and everyone is healthy and able to do what they want.
That’s all that matters."
"Look at it from another angle, she could be saying that you are smarter but she didn't want to put  it in the is way as will demoralise your sister. Be positive"
I will feel sadder if I were your sister.
"If the previous OP is at 75th percentile of sci (based on the info given by admin), and the sister is at 25th percentile of comp sci, they probably will get approximately the same pay of 3.5k based on the graduate employment survey.

They say a happy couple gains weight together :v 
Be more appreciative and value her regardless of her weight. Since she never complain you poor why are you complaining her fat?
Dump that fat fuck
So you got together because of her looks? 
Revenge is best serve double. Gain 16kg and see if she leaves you.
Weight gain could be a sign of something more serious. Maybe check-in on her? 
Turn off the lights
"If she goes from bmi normal weight to overweight, it's also not healthy (I calculated and it is very possible for the person in question to be from normal weight to overweight with 8kg gain). And I googled, having a high BMI during pregnancy (being overweight + the usual weight gain during pregnancy) increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth etc.

Also, based on google, women may hold on to typically about 2-5 pounds above their usual weight after pregnancy, which converts to 0.9-2kg, not an 8kg weight gain after pregnancy.

Just talk to ur gf about it, like health risks and stuff. You can make an exercise plan with her, starting with easier exercise stuff, like maybe go for couple walks first. Then slowly, increase uh. Exercise also not easy and you can do it with her so more motivating."
Get fat yourself lor then won't have problems Liao
Pang Yat Yan for us is that we both put on weight hahahaha x.x
Have more sex with her. Sex burn calories.
"Physical attraction is a huge part of a relationship. We're not all holy saints (or perhaps hypocrites) that can say we don't care abt looks. If u can't accept her weight now, imagine 10 years, 20 years, even 50 years down the road. Fat and fit is a letter apart, but also worlds apart. Don't waste your youth if she won't change."
Get her on hgh her motivation to exercise will suddenly skyrocket
Gg wait till she gets pregnant. I think loving exercise goes q long way not just for looks you know. There is health benefits and also q testament to mental fortitude
"You can approach it in a keep healthy because i care about you, instead of a superficial, its all about 'my' preference for sex kind of manner"
8kg is a lot leh omg
"Complain so much, leave la 😒 She don't want change, what's it to you to force it?

It's not just males cannot comment on female weight. It applies the other way round too. If you not happy, just leave and find someone who suits you (and your eyes) better, instead of complaining here."
"If a person refuses to change their lifestyle even when there is an issue with their health, it says alot about their character and personality"
"Sometimes you discover you can't stand your significant other's shopaholic habits, or you can't stand their laundry habits, so you just COMMUNICATE it. Couples should be able to do that, and grow together in a positive way. 

It's not a take it or leave it, but working through it kind of thing, if you want a long term relationship. 

Fitness and health is something that can be worked on too. Like for myself, I also tend to eat a lot and am quite a lazy ass (always grabfood). So my bf did talk about it being quite unhealthy  (even if I got a fast metabolism rn, it won't last forever), and we compromise on it like for me to snack less and walk to get food instead of just ordering. It's not just beauty, it's for one's health."
"Exactly. Cannot live with it, then don't. Waste everybody's time."
"If youre married you have no choice. But if you haven't tied the knot, its not too late to reconsider if you can live with it."
"Ok took me a while to catch up on what was going on. So here's my thoughts:

1) THERE IS ALWAYS A SILVER LINING, even for weight gain by gf. How so? 

Well, I assume by gaining weight == become obese and less attractive. In that case, the bf can worry less that she will run road with other peeps right? So much effort can be saved trying to keep her on your side :') 

Or maybe the bf is the legit nice guy type till the point where the gf can just eat and eat and feel so secure that the bf won't dump her. 

Imagine if one day she suddenly have a change of hearts and keep exercising until super model level, I think the bf will have a different set of worries.

So for now, nothing to worry la~

"Well, is this course free? If its not but it still fits within your budget/timetable, then just try if you have some free time to spare~ (better than rotting at home/hall). You never know, you might meet some kindred spirits along the way there.

Anyone can get the cert easily. How fluent you can demonstrate the learning objectives is another story. Obviously a few certs won't land the job if you still fail the aptitude tests / panel interviews.

If your portfolio is not very impressive (well competition is everywhere nowadays), do not dismay. At the very least, having certs shows your willingness to learn new things outside your domain and that is admirable and probably goes a long way if you continue to work on it! Not sure about you, but I am always faced with new things to learn on the job...

Those that have a good portfolio may also not have the temperament/humility to work for someone as well (not good fit within the organization)~ Regardless, do what you do best!

Dun bluff lah. 
"I was a little fat before, as even for us guys, it's not as easy as ""just eat less and you will slim down"".

In fact, I was exercising regularly at that time but as a result of that, I was eating more due to burning more energy.
It came to a point where I was eating four full meals a day. That probably caused it.

But I didn't know how to manage it, because after some time, your body becomes accustomed to that amount of food, and when you try to eat less, you'll get gastric or tremors (due to a lack of sugar?).

You probably need a dietician or coach to help in such cases. Going it alone is not easy, and when people abandon you for being ""fat"", it makes it worse.

I was single at that time but I can imagine how painful it is to be dumped for being ""fat""."
"It is not about the weight gain, but about the insistence of not changing for the better. 

Life is full of obstacles and crises, but do we wallow in self pity forever? Do we bathe in alcohol (turning alcholic and insisting not to seek help) for a decade because we perceive and are perceived as a failure compared to our spouses (esp for guys given the male ego)? Do we not seek any upgrades and just cry that the world is unfair (and stay where we are) when we suck in academics?

When we do something, and even when we do nothing, it is our choice. When I was working as an admin, there was this girl who had been working there for a few years and she didn't take a degree after A levels (poor results). However, she felt some regret being at the position where she is, stagnant and not much progression. But she made this decision to not remain at that stagnant position, to apply to uni and went to uni after.  She made her choice.

The OP said so himself, that his gf refused talks of change and about her weight. That is her choice, to stay stagnant where she is.

I agree we should have empathy, and that change is not easy. We can be supportive to people who are willing to change, and be patient. But for people who aren't willing to change, we also cannot do anything about their choice."
Keeping in shape is a choice. Gaining weight is a choice. Breaking up because that person gain weight is a choice. Everything in life is a choice. We have no right to judge other people choices. It's their choice and they have to face whatever outcome that comes with that choice. Choice.
I think it could be more than just gaining weight. Some people just gave up on taking care of themselves
"Please weight gain is defintely a choice. 
To drink this bubble tea or to drink water
To work out tonight despite being tired or just sit there and nua. 
I was considered fat all the way till poly qnd have always go up qnd down on the scqle, so I know how its like to be overweight and how hard it is to go back down. 
In poly I swim 70 laps a day to lose weight
Gain some back in army then before uni 
I workout daily and cut ny diet and went back to normal again.
Gain weight again in uni yr 1 qnd 2. Was at 86 last year june. I was 70 btw in year 1 and went to workout daily and control my diet and had kept ip the good habbit since. Now I hover around 77 and still workout twice a day

The point I am trying to make is, caring about your weight and health is a choice, I can choose to be lqzy and let myself reach 90 maybe 100 eventuqlly you know. And then just say nah I don't care, losing weight is too hard let me just sit there blame the world instead."
But the bo-chap attitude is a choice

"Actually those stories you see on IG, do you really think people feel super close to them?  Eating together isn't indicative of how close one actually is to another. It's the openess to have a HTHT and to feel vulnerable or just be there to hear them out and/or give advice that is what matters more.

"People make all kinds of assumptions:

It may be for some people, but not for most. And what about those people who didn't get to go to uni? Have they missed out on something wonderful in life?

In truth, uni is only a very small part of your life. You still have your whole life ahead of you, and so many more people that you will meet.

Work on being a great person so that when the right one comes, he (I'm assuming you're a girl?) will find you very appealing.

Also, don't believe what you see on IG, FB, etc.

"I think it really depends on the context. Is your boss working in a secondary school? Or some tuition centers? Is this worksheet compulsory?
My point is, obviously not everybody is suitable for learning olympiad math. And forcing them into olympiad math is a no-no. You'd scare the students off and cause them to lose focus on the fundamentals being taught.
However, if said worksheet is an optional exercise meant for expanding student's understandings, then seriously you guys dont know how lucky you are. 
The education system should not be focused on 'this wont be tested in O level' or 'I dont see a single of this question from TYS'. Education should be about inspiring, letting students understand and appreciate the subject, not the scope of the exam. And by virtue of olympiad questions, interested students are really able to learn a new way of enjoying mathematics, while enhancing their abilities to think critically and analyze problems logically. Additionally, one could make such a remark: which is better? getting straight A's on high school level exams. or getting a medal in IMO?

This all comes from a person whose life has been changed by olympiad math. My interest sparked late admittedly, and I wasn't able to make it into IMO. But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't the best part of my highschool years. If your boss is still stubborn about making this compulsory, please dont argue about how 'it is not examinable', and instead about the negative effects it has on students who are uninterested/weaker in math."

"Sometimes in life, we can't change the course which the river flows~ Rather than pushing this to your boss, why not use that time and effort lamenting to help the students to understand better / prepare more class materials, isn't that your calling~

Sure they are from NA and may need more effort to learn, but I'm sure with the right teacher (maybe lots more spoonfeeding/effort required - using different tools to get them curious/interested), they should be able to grasp the concept. ""There's no such things as bad students, only bad teachers"".  I'm sure you know where to find motivational stories from ex teachers that have had success handling the NA bunch - and their methods usually require more effort~~ If teach normally doesn't work, then change your tool! 

Maybe for one, try not to classify them as NA and non-NA when it comes to transferring knowledge? This may prevent you from using certain teaching methodologies that you feel not suitable but could otherwise be effective. 

I'm sure we will remember/appreciate the teachers that went the extra mile to help us during our school days and probably forgot those that just do the bare minimum for their role. :) 

I find that argument on asking the elder siblings who got A a little lacking. Imagine you got A for a mod you took in Y1. Then when you are your final year & you have not touched that mod since, one student from Y1 came and ask you for help for a harder than expected assignment. Note that it is not even in your best interest to solve it for them afterall you already finish that mod. E.g. I got A for math in PSLE, but if you were to ask me to do one pri sch Olympiad qn now, I probably won't have time to entertain if you're a stranger (with the exception that I'm super free, or the student is nice). - maybe that's why I'm not a school teacher.

Until she feels comfortable and thinks you are not a freak, then go somewhere nicer or romantic the next time round. Doesn't mean introvert means don't like crowd.

There’s no hard and fast rule here. It’s either she’s interested to meet you up or not. Don’t think too much since she wasn’t “comfortable” 🙃
"I think if she accepted ur invitation means she does have some interest in you. Like what the rest said, maybe ur suggested places made her feel uncomfortable. Could it be too intimate a setting for her? I think she will feel more comfortable meeting in a “public” setting and not so much 1-1 alone time yet? A dinner in a mall or cafe is better than a movie or romantic hiking trail where she might feel awkward with just the 2 of you I guessss. Or do some activity tgt "
"Tell her just a meal first, and she should be fine with it. Otherwise, she is not that into you"
Why not ask her to recommend the place she is comfortable in?
"it's an okay pace for a meet up but the recommended place could be the reason for why she got cold feet. if she's an introvert like you said, the best place for meeting up would be a library, museum, or even a book store and then coffee/tea time afterward. casual and not too demanding, plus a lot of quality conversation (deep ones) if you know how to steer it."
"Are those exotic places in the recommendations that you provided? 

Maybe start with some simple. Maybe a meal at the mall near her home and catch a movie thereafter (when she is free of course). If she still say uncomfortable, then its quite clear cut already --> You can then confess directly so as to not waste anybody's time (Confess to her of course, not here, but welcome)

"I think one thing which amazes me is when people mention, ""she or he is out of my league"". Is there a league to be honest? I keep hearing people talking about this all the time but never really understood it. 

To say you are above someone's league, makes you not only arrogant but as a complete prick because you think someone is lower than you and you come off as high and mighty; which you are really not. So, get your arse of the pedestal because honestly you are not a big deal. No one is. Get off the high horse. Oh that's right. It's a unicorn and it's not real.😏

I never worry about shit like this and I treat people equally. Doesn't really matter who you are, what you are and where you come from. These are things which distract you and make you lose focus on the real things; like connection, chemistry and enjoying the company of the other. Those are things which matter. There is no such thing as ""out of the league"". If it does for you, maybe that is why you are not able to get the guy or girl. You just disqualified yourself there with some imaginary reason which you assume is true."

"Nobody judges you worse than yourself, actually. People are typically too caught up with their own affairs to be thinking about you.

For example, try to remember when was the last time you embarrassed yourself in front of others. You probably can recall it in detail. But what about the last time you saw someone else embarrassing themselves in front of others? You probably can't even remember it.

You'll just get the same treatment even if you were to embarrass yourself when you speak up. People might laugh at the moment and almost immediately forget about it.

So don't worry about screwing up, force yourself to speak up, and learn from it even if you were to make mistakes. That's how you improve."

"Agreed. It's your skill and knowledge that matters. Yes an NTU degree might help secure that first job, but after that, it's your (hopefully updated) skills that make the money and affect your career progression. If you're not getting that job role that you'd like, rather than comparing qualifications, pay, job position or whining, take action to arm yourself with better skills or reputable 3rd party course certs to prove you're worthy for that position to your current (or future) employers. I feel the world moves so fast nowadays that if you're not learning something new in every year, you're probably getting left in the dust to some extent.

If they really took the feedbacks seriously. Many lecturers would already been sacked long time ago.
I think you need to make realistic goals for now and analyze why you got 1.59. Only when you understand why your GPA is like this then you will be able to improve. Best is to review your study techniques or consult your peers who are doing better on how they study. Trial and error bit by bit. Best to aim for lower and more realistic goals for now imo
Zhe Zhi Hui JianHui Too any advices?
"Is not about the GPA but the fight that counts.

1) You need to understand where you went wrong. Do you really know why you had that gpa? 

2) The fight.... dont give up. Imagine is you really struggled and get ur 4s and 5s GPA! Perhaps is possible for u to still get 2nd Upper! That will be a story for you to tell your interviewers in the future~"
"The question here is how much effort did you put in to achieve 1.59? If youre telling me you played the entire sem, then yes, you probably could improve if you study. (To what extent is unknown)

But if you studied and still got 1.59, your study techniques need to be looked at again and ask yourself if you truly understood what is taught"
Can find job already and not think so much 
"If you need school's helps/advices, you may email to your school's caring center. I used to come to meet them, they were very friendly, asked something and even planed your learning paths for/with you. If you are in SPMS, you may contact Dr. Alessandra Bonanni.

Personally, I guess you should know/guess why you got low scores, at least through your CAs. If you don't know, email to your profs to ask. They may due to your calculations/your knowledge - you didn't learn them through lectures/you added a lot of mods, cannot learn all of them/ or some other reasons. Try to invest more of your time in learning, at least try to ""solve"" them in the following semesters first. Life is a long learning journey, don't worry. Hope that it can help you."
"Vanessa I thought y1 fail mod is not counted in gpa, just need retake? "
Fabian Wong Damien Sng thoughts?
I think you should aim lower maybe a 3 first. After you achieve the 3 then aim for 4.
"Getting 4.0 is the least of your worry now, you need to take a deep dive into your study technique, your ambition, your willingness to sacrifice everything else than academic result, etc. 

Typically Y1 module is the easiest to score, however, I do know quite some of my friends who can pull their grades from third class to first class after Y1, determination is the key."
"You will have to retake those modules if they are your core. You will also have to relook into your studying techniques and see what went wrong. Your cgpa still has a chance to hit 4.0 in future, but that will require some extremely serious hard work. One step at a time, pull up your cgpa to above 2 first. "

"I guess you don't know about bell curve. Those assessments are before bell curve. Since many do well, the grade to get A will be set even higher. The bell curve is only applied right before the release of the final result which is the release of GPA day."
If a few people are getting B and C while doing well and the rest are getting As. Then there might be an issue. But if majority are getting B and C then there is unlikely any issues with the grading. Just accept your grades and move on. There nothing you can get about it except making yourself feel miserable.

"C'mon guys, it's the 21st century. The sad truth is with or without you, there's ain't a significant impact in her life. So why make the effort to change her life to have you in it."
Because you are thinking too much. Your female crush doesn't like you
"Fear of rejection. It's not men don't have it too but generally, we are used to it; we are expected too. It's not women can't handle rejection, they are just not used to it. Also, society expects them to take a backseat in this kinda areas and let the men lead which honestly is ridiculous because if you want something, you go get it. Period. But it is what is it now and you empathize for the ladies too. 

However, on the flip side there are girls, (some of my female friends do and I completely respect it) who do make the first move but the guys do not like that thinking they lose their masculinity because of it. Farking ridiculous, having a flawed understanding of masculinity. In this case, what can the girls do?"

"This OP has been spamming tons of rubbish confessions. 
E.g.
OP is always posting stuffs about a handsome blonde guy from certain school (most probably upselling himself). 

I don't get your point for doing so. Each confession come from different characters. I do not know what you are trying to achieve. Please spend your time more wisely. I wish I have that abundance of time you have. You either seem extremely bothered by some issues or is just a complete troll from birth. Please PM if you need someone to talk to.

Why doubt urself if u know u did well? If you really care about your grades and if it affects your overall class of Honours, u shud spend it. $10.70 is nothing compared to your future (if u think it might affect ur future). 

But ofcos there's a slight chance u might end up with an ever lower grade. It's like a gamble. But believe in yourself man."
"If they made a mistake and your grades change (for the better or worse) , the $10.70 will be refunded back to you. 

Give it a try if you think B- is really unexpected. If you succeeded , it’s not just the $10.70 that got refunded , and in fact the grades don’t matter , you will have a new story to tell... just like me. 

I kept that $10.70 cheque and didn’t cash in...  "
Why not you just spend that $10.70?

"You don't have to worry about what grades people are entering with, if you are good enough yourself. 

Through my course of uni, I realized that people who compare a lot of their grades/opportunities also happens to be mediocre at best (not that bad, but not that good either - as in their grades/opportunities are those of the majority so idk what they comparing about). 

Maybe it's time to quit comparing with people worse, rather strive to actually be good yourself?

In saying that I'm not stating all average people compare, but rather those who compare mostly to those worse off tend to be average people."

"It genuinely disgusts me that such a mentality continues to plague our education system wherein, instead of being happy that many more individuals who may not have done as well in their exams but who are talented and desirous of an education can now get that opportunity to learn and do better, people like you take great joy in seeking to make university education exclusive."
It's a good thing that NTU is giving a chance for those who got Cs and Ds. Lets not judge people based on their grades.
Then drop out lor. Very disgusting to study in the same school as people getting Cs and Ds right?
"IGP is not an accurate way of ranking universities. IGP reflects the popularity of the courses and the seats (or lack of) in different courses. It is not and should not be used to rank universities.

wtf dude a poly guy in my batch has 9 CORE mods this sem only... meanwhile i only have 5. yes they do have exemptions but they also graduate in less time so...
Wow what a dense mf hiding behind her uwu speech 
fewer
Feels like a Karen in making lel. 
"The fact that they can commit more resources to your group project, and still everyone gets the same scores for it, is indeed unfair to your poly friends.
You, who contributed lesser, should get lower grades for the project."
"Hi im from poly and in accountancy in NTU. The problem about exemption, accountancy was given only 1 exemption for poly students. If you are saying poly had an easy life, i can tell u no. As a poly student, i worked my ass off to get stellar grades. Not only i maintained my grades every sem, we also have diploma plus that partnered with other institute, providing the courses that was UK degree equivalent. I did not take any exemption. When i was in the accounting class, i find it very easy and boring because everything that was taught in lecture, i was aware already. 

Only about 15% of the top poly students get placing in ntu. What if jc gets a cap of 15% too? What will you feel? The immense stress faced upon you, thinking that once u fall short of the 15%, you cant get into big3 uni. 

In several projects, some jc kids have really no EQ and no creativity. Some of them just slammed my idea off when it was in fact better. 

It is okay, i let my success make the noise. Im on the fch road and im proud."
"Are you.... just too blinded by your own privileges? If you don’t see the time they already invested beforehand... if you don’t recognise time as a factor of consideration, then u can delay graduation too, u will be able to take 2 mods “less” per sem too 🙂. Please lah, poly student pre-uni education already 1 year longer than yours, faced fiercer (uni) entry competition, & had to maintain CGPA 3 years before you (not saying Alevel east but o’well). Then you calling this unfair? Delay grad loh."
"Oh, summer child, sweetheart, ""I didn't have the luxury of time as compared to the poly people""? We all have the same time. What sucks is your time management."
ofc it's a jc kid who spent 2 years in a glorified secondary school complaining again 😳 
Fuck u and ur jc privilege. Poly masterrace
"They had 2 mods fewer, but you entered uni 1 year before them."
"From the way this is written, I could tell your inability to “give as much” is definitely not because you “didn’t have as much luxury of time”. "
This is called equity. What you're asking for is equality. Look up the difference and you'll understand this system 😊
"No point to go JC nowadays！！
If you score mediocre in JC, NTU & NUS reject you becoz of poor grades; SIT & SUTD reject you because of lacking practical application.

Might as well go poly as the chances of doing well is high and easily accepted to local universities"
Haha...unfair huh? They have gone through their unfair part of life as well. Maybe you need to broaden your mind and stop giving excuses. And getting exemption is not a luxury...it’s just a higher risk of getting lower gpa.
"They had extra one year more than you. Imagine how many mods they have taken in that one year in poly? Also poly GPA is like university GPA they are continuous. It's harder to score. You fk up one mod, everything is screwed up and you have to work even harder next semester to catch up. Some can't even catch up despite working harder. JC is like you only need to worry about your finals. I'm not saying A levels are easy. It's just that is harder to maintain a high GPA in poly. Despite working hard and getting decent GPA, only a handful graduates are able to get placement in local university. The majority of the slots are taken by JC students. So the take away message is life is unfair. Everyone go through unfairness in their life. I hope you stay positive and keep grinding. Wish you all the best!"
"Some poly students get exemptions from mods since they've already done it in poly and are thus assumed to be competent enough. You sure you want them to not be exempted? If theyre not exempted from mods that they have done and supposedly mastered in poly, the next complaint from jc students is that the poly kids are skewing the bellcurve smh

It's like asking a poly IT student to do an intro to programming mod. Theyre likely to get super good grades since they've been there and done that before, which skews the bellcurve and then screws the rest of the cohort over. You end up having to work extremely hard to grasp and understand concepts that are taught within 1 sem when they've spent the past 3 years learning and mastering it. Isnt that more unfair?"
"Oof Melissa Then  ""a bit unfair"" "
Yong Cf good read 
"2 mods FEWER, not 2 mods less"
"Yes, poly students can apply for an optional exemption for a number of AUs of GERPE and UE.

If you wanna analyse the fairness of it, however, we can go all day. Poly 3 years, JC only 2. Some degrees are 5 years direct masters, some 3 years bachelors, some 4 years with honours, some 4 years without. 

And let’s not forget, poly students face a CAP on the percentage that can enter university per batch. That’s clearly unfair, right? Are you concerned by this? And don’t say it’s because poly students couldn’t make it to JC when many are now entering poly even with JC-level results. 

You say don’t get you wrong, but you bring it up anyway because clearly this “unfairness” is eating at you. “Unequal effort”? Some classes are clearly harder than others, some profs grade more strictly. You’re going to go insane over your years in NTU if you feel slighted by every single difference just because it works against what you think you deserve.

Don’t mistake “fairness” with pure “equality”. What is fair may not be what is equal."

"Maybe the OP of #NTUConfessions30203 could have phrased his/her question better, but I don’t think it is particularly fair to say that JC students had it easier than poly students. For JC students, we basically only have 1 chance to earn our ticket to university - A Levels, and if we fuck it up, then that’s it. Either we suck it up and apply for other courses, or wait an entire year to retake A Levels again. And it’s not like we are guaranteed to do better the second time.

Both JC and poly students have it tough, just in different ways."

"Move out, change hall. Just get away. There are tons of other halls and you can just try to enquire about any potential noise situation."
I usually don't comment but I suggest getting a fire range ear muff. I currently use pro for sho 34dB bought from Amazon Singapore. My room is next to a primary school amd it helps me a lot whenever there's some events there or even renovations nearby. I have always been super sensitive to noise so I can feel you....
"I can imagine the feeling you get when you hear sounds that annoy you, I often feel the same way as well when I hear pen-clicking, lip smacking, small sounds when I'm trying to sleep etc. I often feel agitated and feel the urge to tell the person to shut up. 

My experience with anything noise cancelling (headphones, earphones, earplugs) is that they sometimes make inconsistent noises more annoying. Because you're blocking out all the ambient sound, any sound you do hear through the blocking is exaggerated and might be more annoying. 

Something you might be able to try is to get some earplugs, and maybe a small speaker with decent quality (so it doesn't sound too harsh/tinny), and then play some white noise on the speakers, such as rain sounds. 

So you will use the earplugs, then play the speakers at a volume that is about the same volume of the sounds bothering you. This way the white noise will mask out any noise, and you'll have earplugs to protect your hearing somewhat. Hopefully it's at a volume that doesn't bother your neighbours tho. 

You can try this when you're sleeping as well."

"A lot of zero calorie drinks have artificial sweeteners that are harmful to body. It disrupts your hormones production.

On a deeper level, obsession towards coke itself can stem from much deeper issues, usually from repressed experience(s) as far back during childhood. Sometimes, u have to ask urself what do u really crave. Is it coke? Or is it something else which u subconsciously associated with coke due to whatever repressed experiences u might have. If your craving for coke fluctuates, observe urself and see when it goes up and down. Look at the pattern of fluctuation and try to see the correlation between your cravings and what u're going through. This helps you to pick out clues in what u're truly craving. This thing that u truly crave can be as abstract as attention from friends or loved ones. If drinking coke used to be a favorite shared past time between u and ur loved ones when young, u would hv subconsciously learnt that drinking coke brings u closer to ur loved ones, and ur cravings would surface whenever u feel distant from them.

"I drink close to 1 litres of coke zero everyday. I workout 6times a week, i do calorie counting and i still can lose approx 0.7kg a week.

Freaky eater cola edition
"not a health related degree undergrad but stupid pharmacy in poly and had read up many research journals about the sugar free alternatives.
long story short
humans are not able to absorb whatever they put in diet free drinks and yes, it really has no sugar. however it's really not clear if heavy consumption can lead to metabolic syndrome. which can still cause associated problems like diabetes ect. my advice (not medical) would be to replace normal soda with diet soda. but not drink more because u think diet soda is harmless
"
Holy cow! You will get pancreatitis if you carry on drinking like this!!
"Coke zero uses artificial sweeteners, so you won’t be that high in risk of diabetes. However, artificial sweeteners might affect how your body absorbs regular sugar. Read up on the long term effects of aspartame or other artificial sweeteners. 

If you can cut it off completely, then it’s the best, but I would say zero/light > regular coke.
"
"Coke Zero still go sugar what. You believe when it says it is zero in sugar? Like what you mentioned, you claim that it is healthier, where got soft drinks is always healthy choice one? Long term effect? Diabetes lo, better go have your body checked."
"I'm not sure if Coke Zero is really sugar-free, but the high levels of caffeine are definitely not good.

Try to quit Coke completely by going cold turkey; don't cut down slowly because Coke is very addictive, and you won't be able to stop if you merely try to ""cut down"".

I was a Coke addict in my pre-teens and teens. Would wake up in the middle of the night craving Coke. (Incidentally, a Coke addict friend of mine also had this midnight craving symptom.)

Quit cold turkey when I was 21 or so. It can be done, and you won't regret it.

I don't know how this TA thing works, but if he really feels uncomfortable in that class with that girl, can he be excused from it? Maybe just let him help you with your lower sec classes?

All in all, the female student was wrong. Nobody likes to be humiliated in front of a big group. She could have asked you privately instead of creating a scene.

Anyway, be careful of that girl, and all the best. "
"I think you need to mention that making mistakes is normal regardless of who you are. Idk the circumstances but that female student sounds like a handful, better be careful around her. Also the TA should have just redirected the question to you if he wasn't sure of himself."

"After having gone on exchange I have to say NTU's administration is great. I was in the UK, and they wrongly classified me as an African Studies major when I study English Literature. All because I took one module of African Literature. Went to the English office to get it corrected, they told me I had to go to the History office because African studies major is under their department. So I went to the History office, who told me I had to go to the English department because African literature is an English Lit subject under the English department. So I went back to the English dept. They said it's really not their jurisdiction. I kpkb all the way to international students' administration and all they could do was say sorry. Horribly inefficient and useless. Such a mistake wouldn't happen w NTU admin and even if it does, it'd be corrected very quickly. Appreciate the good administrative systems you have here in SG, esp in NTU please. Don't blame them for your own missing of a deadline. "

"Before you take up the PhD, ask yourself a few questions:

1. Why are you doing a PhD? 
2. What are your career aspirations?
3. What’s the job prospect of the PhD degree like assuming you graduate with a PhD?
4. Assuming you want to be in academia, are you prepared to work on a fellowship for the next few years, potentially moving around globally before settling for a professorship in another foreign university?

It’s important that you have a clear objective for wanting to do the PhD, instead of doing it just for the sake of getting a PhD degree.

Also, in case you’re unaware, getting a local PhD in the academia route means that there’s a remote chance of you getting a professor role in a local university (take a look at the credentials of your professors and you’ll probably figure it out).

Last but not least, the risk of being over-qualified for your future career role is very real. If you intend to seek a role in the industry after graduating with a PhD, it’s good to talk to your seniors who are graduating from their PhD to find out about their job hunt. 

Before I graduated, I very much wanted to take on a PhD. It’s only after talking with some seniors doing their PhD that made me decide to try out the industry before coming back to the decision again. I recommend that you do the same thing if you intend to step out to the industry after getting a PhD. "
"I’m not from npgs but I guess I can help you with the general ones since there are no replies.

1. Usually after you write proposal you should have in mind what research you wana do, and which prof would likely be interested in it. You can ask around your postgrads to see if you have good connections around. 
Afaik I have never heard a school change the supervisor for you. There are many cases where you change your supervisor though, hence the fair/transparency is not applicable.

2. For my programme you need to clock 216 teaching hours. I reckon the other programs can’t be too far off. They can be in the form of TAs, taking care of fyps, helping prof with invigilation of ca/ lab sessions etc. If you are taking phd in the same field as your undergrad, chances are the questions by undergrad will not be too tough on you. Anything you can ask your prof.

3. Conference fees are subsidised up to a certain amount and I think npgs should be 4k per year. But don’t worry thanks to COVID nobody knows when physical conferences are gonna take place. You are not paid extra for any excess duties. Only the stipend/ misc allowances are given to you.

4. For my program they withhold 1 month worth of stipend. If you decide to break the scholarship you have to return the stipend/ tuitions fees paid up to that point. Rather than saying quitting is not an option, I advise you to think thoroughly. If you’re in it for the money, you stand to lose out when you compare to your peers who already started work. If you’re in it for the fun of it, you quickly realise this fun drains by the 3-4th month. Pm me if you need more types of answer. "

In fact, I think most knew that applying for exchange now means ""just in case it does get better, we'll carry on with it"". Good planning, NTU GEM office!"
actually when i attended one of the talks from the schools they straightaway told us that summer for 2021 is cancelled and the info may be useful for 2022. LOL
very sad
Stop whining 
What were you expecting lol...
"So should the school have cancelled the program outright? If it was cancelled, people like you might say ""NTU useless, never do anything to help students"" etc. 

The delays showed that they are trying to make things happen for the students, isnt it? Are they having fun giving you ""false hope""? They dont need to spend any effort prepare the system for application, processing your names etc?

Even travel lanes and travel bubbles are getting delayed, isnt it? So there's some vaccine available now, so the pandemic is officially over?"
"Your company is making a very big mistake.

I suspect your nice colleague has been there for a long time, and therefore, he is paid more. So your company wants to cut cost by firing him, and then getting a cheaper, younger person to take over his role. 

But believe me, the cheaper, younger person won't do as good a job, because to reach your nice colleague's level of expertise requires years of knowledge, wisdom, connections, troubleshooting skills and experience, all of which a newer, younger person cannot acquire within one month, or even a year.

That is something a lot of bosses don't realise. They think that it's so simple as firing an older, more experienced staff, and hope that the new person will do just as good a job. It won't happen.

As to whether you should start looking elsewhere, I would say hold off for now. It will only add to your stress & anxiety. Take things one day at a time.

Take care and all the best to you. "

Respect each others boundaries and not question them like a prisoner when he/she meet their friends.
"Hmmmm, well here is just a basic checklist, there might be other instances but your gut feeling needs to help you guide your cognitive dissonance..

You need to be beside them before and after work when you are not even married, attention demanding until you feel like a caged animal, i guess?

You find yourself not meeting your friends anymore because you always need to accompany them until you feel kinda suffocated?

You find them getting unhappy when you want to meet your friends but they can always meet their own friends and they dont include you and you need to be ""understanding""

You cant go on holidays with your own friends but they can go on holidays with their own friends and they expect you to be ok with it

You suddenly realise you no longer have friends because your weekends and activities are just revolving around your SO and you start to question your life decisions

"Sorry you had this experience. It happened to me before with someone - when I text him, he will take days to reply to me, and say that he's very busy, or fell asleep before he could reply.

But later on, I noticed that he's always texting people whenever I am with him. So I knew that to him, I am pretty low on his list of priorities.

So I stopped texting him.

My advice is: Be patient - you will find that someone who will reply to you promptly.

In the meantime, to those who never bother to reply to you, you can quietly drop them off. It's painful, but necessary. 

Personally, I make it a point to reply to everyone who sends me something, even if it's a funny picture. But with many other people, they only reply to who they think is important, especially people with control over their career, like their bosses/supervisor. They tend to take their friends for granted, as a result. "

People have a choice to decide who they wish to reply or not to reply and ignore.
You won't know if they have been ignored before either and they could just be choosing who to reply.
Does it matter?
Calm yourself, gather your feelings.
I understand it is not easy to curb the resent and powerlessness because they are feelings that you are not accustomed to.
Don't lose yourself in the process. 
Keep yourself occupied.
Go gym go for a run go do your hobbies.
It does not matter if people do not value your friendship.
Learn to be alone then. Learn to enjoy your own company.

"Don't expect girls to dress well for you if you're not even considered attractive to them.
And if you want a girl that dresses well, make sure you have the financial means to sustain her materialistic lifestyle ok. Quality cosmetic & skincare products ain't cheap bruhh. The cost of one such product can range from $40-$200. And to look flawless & stunning, the girl probably needs to have a huge collection of such products. For example: Cleanser, toner, serum, lotion, cream/moisturiser, UV sunblock, nightcare products, masks, exfoliator, concealer, primer, liquid foundation/BB cream, eye shadow palette, mascara, false eyelashes, liquid eyeliner, eye pencil/gel, eyebrow liner/gel, bronzer, highlighter, lip balm, lipstick/lip gloss/lip tint, setting powder. Aside from products, there's still clinical visits for laser, botox, chemical peels & etc. Maybe there's more that I missed out but you get the idea. So, make sure you have the means to finance those or at least able to offer something of equal quality, be it fine dining date or expensive fun experience. 😁 You don't expect a girl that dressed to the nines to eat hawker centres/food court/canteen food with you yea? 🤣🤣🤣

Also, do not assume. Maybe the girl stays low profile so that she doesn't attract low quality man/creep. Afterall, if a guy is only attracted by a woman's appearance, then he must be pretty shallow that any smart woman would avoid at all cost to avoid getting her self-esteem destroyed for not living up to the guy's unrealistic beauty standards. 🤷‍♀️"

I love manual drawing though as compared to CAD :/
Probably a good time to change the prof. Content is outdated. No one in the right mind would manually draw stuff. Not in this age. Are we still living in the stone ages? 😂

1. Validate all your feelings and emotions even if it makes you uncomfortable. Say it to yourself, or in your mind if saying out loud is uncomfortable for you. Start with, “I am sad right now, what can I do for myself to make myself feel better? Perhaps going for walk and enjoy the sun?” Or, “I am happy today because...” 
2. Find new people to be in your tribe, because obviously your family is not on your corner.
3. Transform your feed to be one that educates you on self-love, inner work etc. Follow The Holistic Psychologist, Nate Postlethwait, Nedra Tawwab.

 The main rationale extends that public transport are only clean, because people are not allowed to eat/drink. Simply because, people would never clean up if they make a mess, and potentially littering (i have often found wrappers chucked into seats)."

"As a woman who has lived in Thailand for work and one who has MTF transgender friends I share my opinion.  I agree with the writer that men who present as men themselves that commit most of the crimes against women. Those presenting themselves as women also have respect for women apart from their belief that they are female. So it is rare that you will see a man dressing as a woman to take advantage of a woman. Such a person has so much disrespect for women that they will dread even dressing as a woman. There is global evidence from both Thailand and Taiwan. Here is additional information from some forum where I offer emotional support for both MTF and FTM. There are many MTF in Singapore who frequent places like Thailand and Taiwan and present themselves as female fully. Most have good jobs and travel for the weekend to such destinations to present as a female. As I understand from them, they use the women's room since no one bats an eye provided they do not do anything against women. Since the writer claims to have already carried out gender surgery, I would like to suggest to the writer to officially change her gender records. There are many women like me holding good positions and we normally do not mind hiring individuals such as you. We believe that individuals such as you are not only hardworking but also have the creative edge. Apart from HR, the salary is also determined by the hiring manager so do not worry. Please drop me a message with your CV. If there is any suitable position to fill I will get back to you."
Actually rates of domestic violence against women are much higher proportionally among lesbian couples than straight couples. And of course men who present themselves as women commit a small fraction of crimes against women because they represent a small fraction of people in general.

"I would rather have 1000 transgendered women discriminated than 1ciswoman hurt by ONE evil men taking advantage of the concept of gender fluidity. This is my baseline when it comes to gender neutral bathrooms or allowing yet-to-transit transgender women use female toilets. 

Otherwise. I’m more inclined to think gender dysphoria and transition therapies should only have the same restriction of age of consent (16/18). If we don’t allow children to make give consent regarding sexuality or we don’t allow consenting 16+ teens to engage in consensual sex for monetary consideration (prostitution is legal in SG, sub-eighteen prostitution isn’t); then we shouldn’t give consent to children making unalterable decisions on their body. 

Gender dysphoria is currently labeled as not an disorder. I don’t wanna argue. But we have to agree it’s an deviation/mutation, just like autism. You don’t discriminate people with autism, but you don’t hold them to the same standards as you do a “normal” person. Also, if you want universal healthcare to subsidise transition therapy, then you have to agree gender dysphoria is a psychological disorder isn’t it?"
"What has this got to do with the administrators though, and what has this got to do with NTU? o.o"
"You are barking up the wrong tree. I don’t think anyone is arguing that MTF transgenders should not be allowed in female restrooms because they may sexually assault females; the main issue is that certain males with less than honourable intentions may slip into female restrooms while pretending to be transgender folk. 

Don’t see the point in your derogatory remarks regarding the male genitalia, they just make you look silly.

As for your claim of general sexist practices in the workplace, I don’t buy it either, but who am I to invalidate your personal experiences?

"Homewrecker/cheater mentality. If you want to play, go find someone who's game. Don't waste other ppl time, trash"
Actually you can do any xyz even if you’re married. There’s no legal binding to stop you doing a lot of stuff that’s viewed as wrong during marriage. It’s all about mutual consent based on communication and respect. 
"They cannot do xyz with you cause they rather spend time with their bf/gf. If you can’t get the hint, I feel sad for you. Your friends should be more direct with you, since you’re such a prick that cannot accept other people’s choices."

"If the bf-gf relationship is monogamous, then yes, both sides owe each other their loyalty. What you describe is exploring, when no one has agreed to commit to anyone.
Who said you need to get married to be loyal to your partner? How, then, do you account for unmarried monogamous couples who live under the same roof?
You're ridiculous."
"Yes, if you feel the relationship is not working out, you can move on there's no issues with that. Don't listen to the society and their bullshit and make yourself miserable. But at least inform your partner before hand and have a mutual break up."

"I used to believe that individuals getting into a relationship should lead to marriage. However, I realise that marriage is just a social construct, a ""norm"" that society created for couples who are in love with each other. 

There can be relationships which doesn't lead to marriage. For example, you and the significant other were facing a stressful and /or difficult period of life where being with each other gives you the strength to cope with the difficulties/stress (e.g. studying in a foreign land). There can also be relationships where the couple mutually benefit from each other and where they end amicably (e.g. before CNY become BGF, after CNY break up but stay as friends). Then there are those in a relationship but can't get married due to societal norms that marriage is for 1 man and 1 woman.

If you want to, call him out on his actions in front of everyone, and say what his behaviour is petty, childish and immature. 

It may get ugly but it may put his bad behaviour to rest. Also, be prepared that the group may take his side.

The other method is to tolerate and ignore his bad behaviour. Have less communication with him, but be nice and friendly to the others, so that they can see that you are not what that guy painted you out to be.

- Ng"
Story of my life
"I’ve failed many more than 2 midterms in aero, sometimes as bad as getting below 10% of the marks... end of the day still can grad still can get job in industry. Salary not as high as my peers with FCH but tbh if you’re in it for the money then choose a diff industry lol"
"Aero is a really tough course. I ended up with a second upper, but went on to complete my Ph.D. Hang in there!"
"I've been feeling the same pain and asking myself the same questions as you do, and in the end choosing not to look at my test results and ask people how their GPA is made me feel more comfortable. There's always someone more talented than you are but no need to freak out yourself by drawing comparisons. Hope you feel better soon."
"Aero engine degree. The biggest test is whether u will throw in the towel.

Don’t. There’s always a chance out there if you don’t be picky and work at it, even outside aero industry."
"Do not worry, I also graduate with 2nd upper while most of my batch mate got first class.   To me 2nd upper or first class there is not much different in the real world. Your soft skill and experience play a huge part to secure the job. Someone maybe good at studies do not mean he/she is good out in the real world. Do not mind what Prof Ng say about GPA. "
"I am from MAE too. It doesn’t really matter what honor you receive, what matter the most is your networks and soft skills (with a little bit of luck).

Once you enter working environment, your distinctions are no longer being considered if you cannot do your job well. Unless you are working in technical world, your text book knowledge is not really applicable 😂

Just do your best, pursue your passion and be whatever you want to be once you graduate "
"I really empathise with you. I also love planes but I found Aerospace Engineering to be a really competitive course and the modules are not easy. I’m also not a FCH but I’m now still working in the aviation industry and enjoying it so far so please do not be demoralised. Ultimately, you can build up other soft skills in university such that you can gain an advantage in your career ahead. All the best!"
"Whoever you are, I was 3rd class honor. That class was subsequently terminated years ago. How do you feel right now?"
Aerospace engineering is so competitive so being a second upper class graduate isn't too bad la. Passion matters more when come to job. I doubt many of your coursemate would come out and really work in the field. Many people end up doing things which are irrelevant to their study after graduation.  
"Try study with a group if you can? I was also only second upper and back then my pastoral prof can't fathom why I can't score well(i.e.achieve FCH as my JC results was ok) when about 60% of my aerospace cohort was FCH or better. It was demoralising to hear it at that time but I feel you as yr 1&2 coursework might be more difficult to score since they require fundamental understanding of the concepts. But believe that everyone has their own learning pace and you need time to figure work what works for you. I asked for one-on-one sessions with a TA for these mods. Lastly, if you really want to pull up your GPA, you can opt for electives that you know you definitely can score. Coz that's what I did. And to be honest, if you aspire only to be a generalist, your future employer will not ask for full transcript. Hope this helps you."
"""everyone around me has FCH""

Bell Curve: am I a joke to you?"
"Aerospace Engineering is hard, even for someone who loves planes like me. I am from Mechnical Engineering who took an Aero mod (specializing in Aero) and I understand how you feel.

University itself is very tough, just try your best to pass. I tried to have that ""A or nothing"" mentality but i ended up burning myself out. I decided to settle for a pass (can pass can already) mentality and now I am less stress (and it can help you to do better to unknowingly).

Like what one of the above comments mentioned, you can seek internship opportunities in the aerospace sector and start to build connections. Trust me, the aero sector is very small in Singapore, and being a GPA5.0 who cannot work with people is not worth. Starting the connection seeking now is prime for you. All the best!"
Why you can do tutorials but can't do quizzes? They're very different?
Whoever said you need FCH aerospace engineering to be successful is lying. Focus on internships and work on your people skills. Being able to actually do work and work with people is more important.
Whoever said that if you study hard FCH is guaranteed is a lie!

You lose weight because you want to be healthy. Not for people to like you or get a bf. But the most important thing is to love yourself first.

"Its okay to munch when you are stressed from studying.

Some practical and easy to adopt tips:
1. Switch your snacks to something healthier (fruits, walnuts)

2. If you feel that you are overreaching for your snacks, try drinking a full cup of water. At times you might just be thirsty and your body mistook it as hungry.

3. Do a short workout when you encounter stress. No need to force yourself to commit a 1 hour session everyday. Start with 10 minutes a day, then gradually increase when you are ready. 

4. Google is your friend, search for keywords like ""healthy snacks"" and ""useful workouts""

5. This may or may not work for you, try watching success stories of people trying to lose weight on youtube. Tons of it out there. They are real people trying to improve their lives. Keeps you grounded on the process."

After that, I would let them decide - if they are able to respect her and her race, I would bring my gf to see them with their explicit promise that they would respect her and not make her feel unwelcome. If they cannot be civilised and promise that, then you need to decide which side you want to take.

In terms of explicitly trying to break their perception of superiority by highlighting her strengths, I wouldn't do that as it might only reinforce their perception. Instead, if they are willing to be civilised about it, slowly change their minds through action. The best way to convince someone is when they themselves come to that conclusion, not when someone tells them that.

Since we’re living in the world of tech while having many friends, you can probably contact all of them, but half of them will probably choose sign up with either their friend or family. 

50k left. Now, you can start cold calling, you have about 1% chance of securing through cold calls. Congrats!

You must also see your circle of friends. if your friends and relatives are millionaires, you can certainly try to represent them and automatically be top 1%. 

Then you go look at yourself. If you’re a shy person, lower your chance by another 100 times. If you’re a natural salesman, don’t be an Insurance Agent, find a job doing sales. Much more on comms with job prospects. 

Then u see yourself, if you’re a machine with no feelings, ok la. Go for it. It’s only human to feel down while you keep on with the cold calls. 

Otherwise, it’s a good job to do part time so that you can have more time to start your own business or pursue other stuffs."
"Hi hi as a financial advisor I think I can give some insight. Honestly whatever Admin Ng has mentioned is all true. 

Unlimited earnings potential really comes with some assumptions, e.g. what you intend to recommend to clients is what they need, or that the commissions + base pay you earn for every financial instrument you recommend is (for illustration purposes only) worth $2,000 (high earning income illustrated here to show you what ""unlimited earnings potential"" could mean). 

Also, the law of large numbers is true, but it also depends on your network. If you do want to cold call, the probability of people who agree to meet you and accept your recommendations will definitely be lower than the probability of people who are your friends / family. But at the same time, how many friends / family do you have? If you have a strong network, good for you! Join the industry, I'd be glad to welcome you to my team. If you think you don't have such a strong network to sustain yourself in the industry, then maybe even cold calling will be difficult. (To put it simply, you have 1,000,000 friends, confirm this industry no problem for you one!)

Honestly speaking, to do well you'd really have to go out of your way for your clients. It's not just the law of numbers, but how well you treat the people... and whether you see them as just ""numbers"" or people who you really care about. It's not a simple career, and sometimes you may earn less than your peers for those odd months! But it can be a very fulfilling one if you have the right purpose for joining the industry :)"
For every 7 appt you closed one case. To get 7 appt you need to make about 350 cold call. Do you have 700 numbers to call per month to close about 2 to 3 case to earn a decent amount?
"What I feel is that the logic is not wrong. But the base assumption is that you have many unique contacts. Maybe for the first 6 months, you can find different 100 people to talk to. But over time the number becomes lesser and it becomes harder.. 

For a ""fixed salary job"", it is not as fixed as you think. Overtime, the better performance people gets promoted and they get better pay.. 

That's what I feel at least"
nice audit Alfred Lai
"Here's a counter proposal: food delivery. For every 50 calls made (hot or cold), you get 50 appointments and you close 50 cases. Stonks much."
"There is a trade-off between money and time here. You can earn more in your industry if you sacrifice more time, but that time can get increasingly costly as you work longer hours within a day. Weigh your own costs and benefits."
There's only 24 HR a day. So there is a finite limit of how many people you can contact a day
"Unlimited earning potential works only if you have unlimited time and energy to spend.

Also, this works best with robot without emotion swing. How many of us can remain motivated after the 100th rejection? "
"The assumption is that the product you are offering is what they need. Also, that the person may not have already bought the product. Even if they want the product you have, they will more likely approach someone they already know, especially if that person is already handling their insurance. So, only those outside of these assumptions are those who fit in your 100 sample size.  In reality, you might need to call 500 people, of which 100 need the product, do not already have it, and do not know anyone who is an insurance agent. Therefore, you're right that it's a numbers game, but how long can you survive until you reach 500 cold calls to get just 1 case ? And how many 500 cold calls can you make before you give up ? 🤔"
"Don't need to try to counter his logic, I think its more important to understand yourself and whether you are made for this role. I get it, it is hard to find jobs nowadays and more often than not, these insurance agents does not reject their candidates.

If you are interested in this route, you should find out:

1) How stable is this career? What is the BASE salary? And whether if there is CPF contribution? 
I would rather take a career (3k base + CPF contribution) than one with (2k base, potential infinite $ + CPF contribution). In the long run, once you have a family, etc. Stability is very important. 

2) How pleasant/presentable are you? (looks, attitude, conversing, etc). First impression really counts. Naturally, I would more likely buy plans from a cute/smart agent than one that looks like he/she been down the gutter. Find the top performing agents, learn from them. I believe the successful ones should have quite a high level of empathy to be able to connect to people. 

3) Can you really take rejections, especially from the peers you thought you are close to almost everyday from the cold calls. Can the few clients you helped with bring you enough motivation to overcome the countless rejections? 
Under such defeated spirit, can you still perform the best for your current and prospective clients? --> Think hard on what motivates you each day you wake up and whether you can get the same motivation after being an agent.

4) Successful agents do not just cold call but also, become somewhat integrated into their clients' life - always keep up to date with their family/work related issues and more often than not, do beyond what their role entails, making a real impact. (e.g. On the passing of one of client's family member, the agent will spend a huge chunk of his/her time helping/advising the grieving family on the will, etc.). 
Can you weigh the costs of extra hardwork involved for current client & the trade-offs for reaching out new clients? You also, have 24 hours in a day, there is only so much you can do. You probably will build a ""family"" bond with strangers than with your initial close friends and I believe that the longer you stayed in this profession, the more empathetic you will get and by that time, you probably won't be chasing the infinite salary - I don't think this will be your main motivation tbh by that time.

5) Do you see yourself earning enough for your family/yourself when you are in your fifties? I think it will be good to work out this math instead and highlight any potential career jump you can go to. Do consider the fact that you may not have any CPF contribution for the last x years... (its actually quite a lot). You might want to take into account of our median salary and judge for yourself. (Median from fresh graduates to Singapore's median income).

IMO, You might actually be able to earn more in audit in the long term tho (plus CPF) if you have the same amount of zeal/grit demonstrated throughout the career and even that might be more stable since you are now well verse in your trade and probably hold managerial positions~

"i also hate attending interviews, cos i get nervous talking to strangers. but participating in more presentations and mock interviews really help a lot. that's how i overcome the fear for interview."
"Not sure if this is really helpful but I will share my own “secret” for being confident in interviews (and generally, public speaking), can see if this is useful haha: 

First, you know that you are capable and good, and the fact is that some people might not be as capable as you. Even if you answered questions in a mediocre manner you can trust that the interviewer is able to see the difference in your abilities (especially in tech interviews). 

Secondly, let’s take the worst scenario: even if you talked like s**t in the interview, the interviewer still has to listen to you (and I don’t think you will be talking like that since you can do your work well), and you get a chance to practice whatever you want to say. You loose nothing from a bad interview. 

So think about your mind state when you post on NTU confession, it is more or less the same as you present a slice of yourself to others and hoping to see that they get interested. 

Good luck! "

"Hi! Just to share with you my personal experience! I'm in the same situation as you but opposite. I'm working for a year already while my gf is in final year. We decided to buy a resale and we just did! So I'm just going to share with you a few reasons for you to digest! No right and wrong but yeah~~~

1) you being a student while she worked for a year already qualifies both of you for the enhanced cpf grant! By the time you join her in the workforce, if your total combined income is more than 9k, you are not eligible for the grant. This grant ranges from 5k to 80k depending on combined income. 

2) for resale flats, there are 2 other grants which is proximity grant and family grant. Now, there's a difference between resale and bto's proximity grant. Resale's proximity grant is in terms of money while bto's is in terms of additional ballot. 

3) total grant receive can be up to 180k. Now all these grants will need to be paid back into your own cpf account in future with accrued interest. (You gotta find out by yourself by calling HDB/CPF) 

4) now, only your gf is eligible to take a loan to purchase the house. With only her income, the maximum loan she can take will be way lower as compared to a couple that's both working. What does this means? This means if you loan lesser, your monthly installment is lesser. Just as an example, if your loan amount only entitles you all to get a 3 room flat (inclusive of grants), every month, each of you may just have to pay 400-600 monthly installment. If both of you decided to get it when both of you are working, loan amount will increase which means there might be a chance you all can get a 5room flat. But monthly installment for each of you may double. So it's really up to both of you to plan your finances. 

5) it is possible to not use a single cent while getting resale if you don't aim for too big a house as your first house (due to grants and loans). 

6) there's a lot to consider but last but not least, you 2 have to come to an agreement whether to purchase and think about the finances if you do purchase it now. Will she be willing to pay the monthly installment by herself first till you get a job? Are you all willing to renovate the house slowly? Because renovation is another huge cost! Also, getting resale means you 2 have to ROM within half a year upon getting the keys. 

Personally, we decided to get because for long term wise, we calculated it and we would be having an advantage by taking the grants early. But, it's really a committment and a lot of planning is involved. So yup! Discuss with her and understand if her reason she suggested this is because she have calculated everything and it's feasible or if it's just her want? Feel free to research using HDB website or spam call them to understand. That's what we did 👍"
"Do the math for her and show her the reality of owning a house in Singapore. If she thinks money will drop from the sky, ask her to top up whatever you can't afford! Honestly money is a very sensitive issue and if she disagrees... find someone who agrees LOL "

If the timeline is not agreeable then you guys need to decide what’s best for yourself. 
Money is a sensitive topic for sure but it’s not something you can avoid. Also, about getting a resale, may be you can discuss with her to opt for bto option. "
Well... Do the maths right in front of her...

"For Cassandra Choy, formerly a relationship manager at a bank and now a financial adviser of an Independent Financial Advisory firm, her bucket list looks a little something like this:

• Buying her first Chanel handbag 
• Buying her first private property 
• Buying her first continental car in her favourite colour 
• and having her first million in liquid assets before 30.

Ambitious as it may seem, at age 29, Cassandra’s already three quarters of her way there. Over the past few years, she has bought the Chanel Boy handbag, the Audi A3 Cabriolet (now wrapped in satin pink), and of course, the private property – a 2-bedroom unit at Bartley Ridge condominium.

"TBH as management, you need not be smart and technical, but you need to learn who the smart ones are and get them to work for you. One needs a good action plan. 1. Identify what needs to be done in your department, ie consolidation, moving forward etc, etc. 2. Set your vision according to what needs to be done in your department, ie if moving forward set benchmarks etc. Talk to your bosses regarding that. 3. Figure out the technical skills requirement to fulfill your vision and deploy the appropriate personnel to do so. 4. Ask for daily summary reports of progress and get feedback from the ground. Terminate anyone who goes against your vision and reward those who play ball. Read Romance of Three Kingdoms as it is a great study in people management. GOOD LUCK!"

"To all the “spoon-feed” comments, do you realize mods like CZ2006 are seriously out of date and need a review. Not only are lecture contents extracted randomly without a clear outline, the techniques taught are mostly irrelevant in the industry practices. Can you believe we are taught to use SVN in 2021? NUS, on the other hand, teaches students techniques at least “relevant” like git. They also has a system to track and review code contributions in a group project using git. Would you call a more up-to-date, sophisticated way of education “spoon-feeding” and blame all on the students who paid top tuition and expect to receive equivalent education?"

Don't hope for SCSE to spoon feed you. Go and learn by yourself. In real work no one is going to spoon feed you. 
"Software engineering (SE) fundamentals are suppose to be self-taught. You have 4  years to learn many different libraries, etc. Those can be self-taught which what many  other countries people are doing so and having SE jobs without a degree. SCSE did make a right direction to teach more towards management style for SE. Infact, I think SCSE did a good job in all the year 1 and 2 mods. Only flaw in SCSE is their year 4 Technical Electives are way too basic to be useful as compared to NUS's computing so need to have better time management to do your own study while managing school's work."
"you took the wrong job, go find the right one"
"You have 4 years to learn the basics and u didn’t bother about it... you expect school to spoon feed everythjng to you is it?

"Not sure with regards to anything about the SU VP but most, if not all, official students organisations have a legally binding doc known as a club consititution and in some (at least mine), there is a provision where executive directors/office bearers can be removed from positions.

I think most students are unaware about how serious running a club can be. As a president of a club and an executive director in some of the other student organisations, I'd like to share that there can be very serious consequences for not properly executing one's duties. Non-Constituent clubs (clubs not under the student union) are very often registered under the Singapore Registry of Societies and have to provide audited financial statements every year and file tax returns. Failing to do so may result in a fine from the government. Running an NTU club, especially a non-constituent one, is a lot more difficult and serious when compared to JC or Secondary School Clubs."

Hello! I may be able to help. Please dm or email me. We can schedule a time to chat further.
"Hello there! 
Be proud of how far you have come despite having so much to bear. You have been really, really strong, and I hope you know that. 🙆🏻

I can't really telling if you're graduating this year or not so soon... but since you are at least halfway through or reaching completion of your degree, don't lose faith and complete it so that your past efforts aren't going to waste! 🙂 

It hasn't been easy for you but keep pressing on! Like what many have said, GPA is not everything, although it may seem very important to you now as an undergrad. In reality, after your first and/or second job, GPA is history.

On the brighter side, there are still ways to build your portfolio & résumé, such as beefing up your work experience by applying for internships in the relevant fields during the summer break. If the company you interned at have a good experience with you, you can get your reporting officer to write you a recommendation letter to vouch for your skills, qualities & character. You might even be able to score yourself a contract to work with them post-grad!

Also, at the end of the day, securing employment is still largely based on how well you pitch yourself to the employer. You can tap on the career coaches from the CAO to help review your résumé and for interview tips.

Have faith that you will see light at the end of this tunnel. Take heart & all the best! ◡̈"

"Hi, you may consider approaching the school student care office for assistance.
They may be able to direct you to apply for some NTU financial assistance. You could also seek academic advice."
Don't let GPA define you.
"Jiayou bah. All I can say is go for internships every summer break. This way, your resume will be more colorful and you get to earn money too. I would rather you go for internship related to your course than do part-time ad-hoc job that won't contribute to your resume. Start hunting for internship soon before May so you can secure a position first."
"Keep at it. Don’t worry about your GPA. Most companies only want to confirm u have a degree and usually applicable to your first or 2nd job. After that, they’re only interested to see what experiences and skills you have and how u do your interview. Good grades dun confirm a job if u screw up during interview. When u land your first job, with your “can do” attitude, learn as much as u can, volunteer for projects, don’t be afraid to get hands dirty. Then u can build up an impressive resume. 

Finally, the future is still in your hands. The tough past is what made your strong character. "
"I was kinda in a similar situation as you right during my first semester. I even thought of quitting school to work back then. Shit happens so you gotta pull yourself up. I went from cgpa of ~2 to ~3 and now waiting for 2021 convocation. Even got offered fulltime job with pay of ~4k which is the median pay for this year.
