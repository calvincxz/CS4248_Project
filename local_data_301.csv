1,"DIU~~~~ This HGC really asking for it... Later garhemen say all CB dont allow smoking, then you see how many butts you need to eat from every smoker…"
0,"I do agree the LTA officer acted in a professional way, but who confronted who in the first place? LTA said the delivery rider confronted the LTA officer, was that so?? If the rider has been smoking in a non-prohibited place, why did the officer confront the rider? Doesn't he know how to put on a mask properly? Anybody would get upset if an enforcement officer confronted you even though no offence was made. If the LTA officer has mistaken the rider for not putting on a mask while he was smoking, why can't the officer apologies for the mistake? This rider must be very upset for being confronted by so many enforcement officers when he did nothing wrong, but members of the public eyes thinks otherwise."
0,Excuse him...he has no other job.....sure he learnt his lesson... delivery is now very competitive...just give him a break this time.
0,"Because of this LTA officer, the rider still have $300 in your pocket, at least for now. In the end, this money will be spent on cigarettes anyways...sigh."
1,rider no one say you cannot smoke but pls once you inhale the cigarette smoke quickly cover up your mouth with mask and let the smoke exhaust out from your ash hole you understand CCB
1,You dont be so DumbCCB Ash*le can or not? .. Inhale cigarette then put on mask on and off ?? Your blardy common sense teach u is it? U want rider to dye from smoking is it.. Damn stuppiak people think this way is it.. If jogger and those exercise can have priviledge not wearing mask then why smoker cannot only 10 or 15 minutes only somemore the smoke is like fumigation who knows help to kill bad air around like kill mosquitoes ... SO USE YOUR BRAIN... USE YOUR BRAIIIINNNNNNN OK!
0,"""Smoke helps kill virus "" Then everyone from now on must smoke to kill corona virus ."
1,"from the conversation and tone , it obvious who is the sucker"
1,He's smoking in a smoking corner. And he's delivery rider so he's always outdoors. What's wrong with that? Dumbass authorities just want to hit their KPIs
0,The officer didn't fine him.
0,Blindly enforcing cos newly instilled power so he is power hungry

0,"See a small group of Grab Food deliverymen gathered together on the ground floor chatting happily everyday when they have no business. Approached them nicely and explained to them the CB measures, they all got up and surrounded me wanted to pick a fight. Even patrolling policemen also closed one eye and oblivious to them. Where is the law, LAWrence Wong?"
1,Why bully the old uncle who is trying to help YOU by only doing his job! IF you got the balls go directly to our own Singapore Minister's! Ask them ALL the questions about our country LAW! How to smoke with the Mask on? Why so many foreigners getting Singaporean jobs. SMOKERS CANNOT BE THAT STUPIDLY BLOODYFOOLS!
1,And uncle talks politely too. Not like the dumb delivery creature.
0,"Actually, everyone is stressed. Rider just puts on his mask after smoking and continues with his deliveries. In addition, not an easy job for the enforcement officer. Hope CB ends soon."
0,You don’t have to like what he does. But the fact is simple the govt according to you or rather mr Lawrence wrong did not they say you can’t smoke ? Further the more he was smoking at right location. Was that a crime ? No. Further more you don’t think NEA already knows all these hotspots?
0,So you answered your own argument. It’s not crime. Obviously I am learned I don’t have to try. In this case it was the you and the unlearned LTA officer who was trying too hard
0,"Boy boy, do you challenge someone who gives you sound advice? Somemore that someone explained to you nicely but not being nasty. Whether breaking law or not is another story. It is more about the personal moral and upbringing."
0,Agree. People are trying too hard to challenge at even a very small issue
1,Wow !!! Weather or not breaking the law is another story ? You are joke to the judicial system IN Singapore 🇸🇬 Law is not made for u to follow because it’s convenient for u. It’s all for all the time u moron
0,The cigarette smoke must have clouded his brain.That officer was only reminding him nicely to wear his mask for his own good and that of other peoples and yet he still blew up.
1,Must put on mask when talking and taking video la bodoh. We don't see anyone smoking in this video la bodoh
1,"Grab where got time to bother all these monkeys, he care more about his lifestyle and pockets.

Grab where got time, he care for his apps, so monkeys poke apps everywhere!!"
0,Take video of them & make report. This kind of CB behaviour not acceptable.
1,Looks like the officer is having a hard time trying to educate a Donkey. Reserved one Goody Bag for the officer once everything is over give him the Bag of Goody.

0,Most properly a warning given because she is the VIP under CECA. Another wayang.
0,It’s a harsh statement. Not all Singaporeans are racist. Only few. And we should not be like them because of them. Let’s not make a generic statement as such. Let’s be matured individuals.
0,"But those majority kept quiet and allowed racism to happen. 50 years, nothing was done. So when we keep quiet we also become a party to the crime."
0,Definitely not. But to curse a majority saying everyone will suffer and god should punish them ain’t sanity either.
0,Foreign Workers got infected totally due to fault of locals. These workers got infected due to careless behaviour of locals.
0,"Regardless of race, lang, religion or nationality...one who don't respect the law and putting public health at risk shld be dealt with by the law in the most severe form......the last we want is such action set a precedent for others to follow..........Only with every single individual's social responsibility that this nation and society have a fighting chance to stem the tide of this Virus..."
1,"Why don't send these Covidiots to the dormitories as safe distancing ambassadors, pay them a salary BUT no mask to be put on less they pay $100/day to wear one. Then hopefully these IDIOTS will learn a lesson or two."
0,Yes. That's how it was spread into dormitories. Foreign Workers were made use of as Guinea Pigs and they were put into undue risk till they got infected. Investigation should be conducted as to how this virus was allowed to spread into dormitories
