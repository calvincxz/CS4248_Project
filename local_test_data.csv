1,"DIU~~~~ This HGC really asking for it... Later garhemen say all CB dont allow smoking, then you see how many butts you need to eat from every smoker…"
0,"I do agree the LTA officer acted in a professional way, but who confronted who in the first place? LTA said the delivery rider confronted the LTA officer, was that so?? If the rider has been smoking in a non-prohibited place, why did the officer confront the rider? Doesn't he know how to put on a mask properly? Anybody would get upset if an enforcement officer confronted you even though no offence was made. If the LTA officer has mistaken the rider for not putting on a mask while he was smoking, why can't the officer apologies for the mistake? This rider must be very upset for being confronted by so many enforcement officers when he did nothing wrong, but members of the public eyes thinks otherwise."
0,Excuse him...he has no other job.....sure he learnt his lesson... delivery is now very competitive...just give him a break this time.
0,"Because of this LTA officer, the rider still have $300 in your pocket, at least for now. In the end, this money will be spent on cigarettes anyways...sigh."
1,rider no one say you cannot smoke but pls once you inhale the cigarette smoke quickly cover up your mouth with mask and let the smoke exhaust out from your ash hole you understand CCB
1,You dont be so DumbCCB Ash*le can or not? .. Inhale cigarette then put on mask on and off ?? Your blardy common sense teach u is it? U want rider to dye from smoking is it.. Damn stuppiak people think this way is it.. If jogger and those exercise can have priviledge not wearing mask then why smoker cannot only 10 or 15 minutes only somemore the smoke is like fumigation who knows help to kill bad air around like kill mosquitoes ... SO USE YOUR BRAIN... USE YOUR BRAIIIINNNNNNN OK!
0,"""Smoke helps kill virus "" Then everyone from now on must smoke to kill corona virus ."
1,"from the conversation and tone , it obvious who is the sucker"
1,He's smoking in a smoking corner. And he's delivery rider so he's always outdoors. What's wrong with that? Dumbass authorities just want to hit their KPIs
0,The officer didn't fine him.
0,Blindly enforcing cos newly instilled power so he is power hungry
0,"Government forgot to mention that besides strenuous exercise, smokers have to put back on their mask after smoking. It's that simple."
0,You know what is inside the greeny bag behind them!! Not all but If you are unlucky.. 1. Unwashed zero maintenance in it. 2. Overnight spilled sauce or dry up soups. 3. Greeny unwashed uniform and helmets. 4 on the way slipper or old shoe if grabie see one. 5. Last but not least all sort of things you cannot imagine including tinny tiny little ones.  Enjoy your meal.
0,Rider should be thankful that the enforcement officer is a really cool guy.
1,"This motherfcuker Is born to give ppl trouble. This LTA Guy is doing as a part of the nation wide exercise during this period of difficult time, I bravo his attitude towards the nation social responsibility. KNN the motherfcuker, challenge everyone who go against his way. I BET he is only good for doing trash and Asap Rokok rokok. My middle to you."
0,"See a small group of Grab Food deliverymen gathered together on the ground floor chatting happily everyday when they have no business. Approached them nicely and explained to them the CB measures, they all got up and surrounded me wanted to pick a fight. Even patrolling policemen also closed one eye and oblivious to them. Where is the law, LAWrence Wong?"
1,Why bully the old uncle who is trying to help YOU by only doing his job! IF you got the balls go directly to our own Singapore Minister's! Ask them ALL the questions about our country LAW! How to smoke with the Mask on? Why so many foreigners getting Singaporean jobs. SMOKERS CANNOT BE THAT STUPIDLY BLOODYFOOLS!
1,And uncle talks politely too. Not like the dumb delivery creature.
0,"Actually, everyone is stressed. Rider just puts on his mask after smoking and continues with his deliveries. In addition, not an easy job for the enforcement officer. Hope CB ends soon."
0,You don’t have to like what he does. But the fact is simple the govt according to you or rather mr Lawrence wrong did not they say you can’t smoke ? Further the more he was smoking at right location. Was that a crime ? No. Further more you don’t think NEA already knows all these hotspots?
0,So you answered your own argument. It’s not crime. Obviously I am learned I don’t have to try. In this case it was the you and the unlearned LTA officer who was trying too hard
0,"Boy boy, do you challenge someone who gives you sound advice? Somemore that someone explained to you nicely but not being nasty. Whether breaking law or not is another story. It is more about the personal moral and upbringing."
0,Agree. People are trying too hard to challenge at even a very small issue
1,Wow !!! Weather or not breaking the law is another story ? You are joke to the judicial system IN Singapore 🇸🇬 Law is not made for u to follow because it’s convenient for u. It’s all for all the time u moron
0,The cigarette smoke must have clouded his brain.That officer was only reminding him nicely to wear his mask for his own good and that of other peoples and yet he still blew up.
1,Must put on mask when talking and taking video la bodoh. We don't see anyone smoking in this video la bodoh
1,"Grab where got time to bother all these monkeys, he care more about his lifestyle and pockets.

Grab where got time, he care for his apps, so monkeys poke apps everywhere!!"
0,Take video of them & make report. This kind of CB behaviour not acceptable.
1,Looks like the officer is having a hard time trying to educate a Donkey. Reserved one Goody Bag for the officer once everything is over give him the Bag of Goody.
1,"This uncle handle the situation well, very patient and polite. Whereas the smoker is damn rude and arrogant. You think you are very smart by asking stupid question? To me, you are just a FOOL."

0,Most properly a warning given because she is the VIP under CECA. Another wayang.
0,It’s a harsh statement. Not all Singaporeans are racist. Only few. And we should not be like them because of them. Let’s not make a generic statement as such. Let’s be matured individuals.
0,"But those majority kept quiet and allowed racism to happen. 50 years, nothing was done. So when we keep quiet we also become a party to the crime."
0,Definitely not. But to curse a majority saying everyone will suffer and god should punish them ain’t sanity either.
0,Foreign Workers got infected totally due to fault of locals. These workers got infected due to careless behaviour of locals.
0,"Regardless of race, lang, religion or nationality...one who don't respect the law and putting public health at risk shld be dealt with by the law in the most severe form......the last we want is such action set a precedent for others to follow..........Only with every single individual's social responsibility that this nation and society have a fighting chance to stem the tide of this Virus..."
1,"Why don't send these Covidiots to the dormitories as safe distancing ambassadors, pay them a salary BUT no mask to be put on less they pay $100/day to wear one. Then hopefully these IDIOTS will learn a lesson or two."
0,Yes. That's how it was spread into dormitories. Foreign Workers were made use of as Guinea Pigs and they were put into undue risk till they got infected. Investigation should be conducted as to how this virus was allowed to spread into dormitories

Make plans to put yourself out there and to explore and experience new things in your life at your own pace. Life is not just about graduating, finding a job, dating and settling down. I started to find more fulfillment in life when I realised that I love children and started to volunteer in places that work with children (that was in my late 20s).

Life is a journey and there's gonna be ups and down and plenty of mistakes are going to made but also plenty of times where you experience joy and fulfillment.

0,"There are some classes. Dr Steven Halim used to teach a web dev class. CS3216 is also primarily web dev. CS3240 prototypes require some amount of front end dev. Sadly I also dk why NUS doesn't have much front end dev classes but I suspect it's due to lack of available experts in this area. NUS is not the only school that's this way.

If you would like to improve your front end skills, try contributing to open source! NUSMods is a pretty high quality front end code base ;)"
0,"Just a spoiler: CS is not all about web development. It is about  computational thinking and applying concepts learnt there. Imho, I don't think frontend can be considered as a subset of CS

Just in case you are missing out, there are some modules here related to front end development 
CS3240 User Interaction
CS3249 User Interface Development 
CS4240 VR and AR User Interaction 
CS4249 Theories of Human Computer Interaction

You can also consider doing some NM modules which are also related to User Interace and User Interaction development."
0,"If you went into CS for some front-end action, I've got some bad news for you 🤡"
0,"That's because web development is not computer science. But NUS SoC has to teach it anyway, because NUS is supposed to churn out SWEs for Singapore industry, or something like that.

I don't think it's useful to say that the focus areas and CS core modules are ""more relevant to backend development"". That's because the backend generally does most of the ""work"", and the frontend is just, well, an interface for users to send requests to the backend and display results from the backend. So since the backend does more work, of course more of CS is ""relevant to backend development"".

If you move more things into your frontend, or god forbid you have a fully-offline desktop app (wow, how unimaginable), then you'll find that those things you consider relevant to backend development are also relevant to your ""frontend"" now. ... Or you might just end up having a ""backend"" and ""frontend"" team even though both components are running in a single client-side application. (Then obviously your frontend team does very little.)

The other problem is that web frontends are so far abstracted away from underlying platforms that you don't even see the amount of engineering that goes into, well, those platforms. There is SO MUCH engineering that goes into developing a browser engine (e.g. Gecko, Blink, Servo, etc) that most frontend developers never see. The browser, frankly, is the most complicated part of any webapp stack, far beyond most typical webapp frontends and backends. You'll find that all those focus areas you think are relevant only to the backend are relevant to browser development too. Need to persist local storage and cookies? Database. Need to resolve a domain, connect to the web server, etc? Networking. (And there is much engineering going on here to develop faster protocols for the web. Look at HTTP/3 and QUIC.) Need to secure your connections over TLS? Security. Need to actually render the page onto the screen? Graphics. Need to make this rendering fast? Parallel computing. Need to have efficient encodings for video and audio? Multimedia. Need to implement a good language for the web and a good runtime for it? Programming languages. And you should look into how React itself works too. Of course, algorithms and theory underlie all of these.

So yes, of course there are few frontend modules, because modern frontend development involves very little computer science. If you want to look into UI/UX theory, that falls mostly under CNM. If all you really want to look at is writing JSX that is shoved into a blackbox that is React.js which spits out nice pixels onto your screen, ... there aren't many principles to study there."

0,"It's important to find someone whom you can connect with sexually, as the intimacy that comes with it is important for a marriage. When you are constantly not having your needs met, you eventually begin to brew resentment and this leads to fights. Hence bad/lack of sex in a marriage seems to make up 80% of the problems. And yet you are also stuck in a predicament because it's not like your partner can do anything to change the fact that he isn't well endowed. I don't have the solution for this but I can understand. I too, was once in your shoes."

0,"It probably means your love language is different from his. Not incompatible, merely different. 

 His love language might not include gifts while yours does. Have that conversation to understand his and how he expresses his. It might just you have a blindside to the way he has expressed his. For example, if one of his love languages is acts of service, he might go out of his way to do your chores for you so you don't need to do them in periods when you're under real stress. 

But that's merely an example. If you can't think of any examples of him trying anything or if he doesn't even attempt to find common ground with you, then don't waste your time and end it."

0,"Different energy different way of showing love and care. Now I want to steer away from negative assumptions here, but perhaps you can hint by doing it yourself. Do little things for him that will keep him thinking about you more often. If he is in the office, get something nice delivered to him. Show you are proud of him, and he is special to you.

Of course if he starts to treat you worse or neglect you even more after some time, you gotta have that talk and get some reassurance this is going somewhere.

But never, ever, start to compare him with others and think he sucks. That kills any guys' morale."
0,"I was *that guy* - the one who focused on the practical, or “keeping it simple” they call it. I used to feel that the frivolous stuff was a waste of money. Flowers, snacks, expensive meals. Etc. 

But it wasn’t until I MYSELF started to receive gifts, notes, texts or just simple kind gestures from colleagues and friends... that I realised how much joy this brought me. That’s when I realised it’s in my power to dispense similar feelings to my loved ones too. 

I then learnt that If money buys good feelings, it’s a good buy. (Please don’t take this out of context) I am just saying couples need to know how to dispense good feelings to one another 🥺

I am confident to say your bf has yet to reach “that stage.”

So you could “bring him up to speed”, teach him and see where it goes from there?

Or leave him and possibly have him learn about this eventually and shower it on his future gf. 

Or let him stay clueless forever (sad life bruh lol.)"
0,"How you want your bf to treat you just do the same way to him (e.g. send him little gift like cookies, bring him to eat his favourite food). You also need to take initiative to hint or ""train"" him. Hope this will make him become a more detailed person. Men and women think differently."
0,"He shows he loves you in other ways ma. Who wouldn't like the whole lil' surprises thingy? They do brighten up anyone's day! But since he doesn't do that kinda thing on his own, maybe you could tell him straight, like ""can you get me cookies this weekend?""

0,"Without thinking about another guy, try to focus solely on the current issue. In relationship, there is no fixed formula. It might be best if you observe if he really thinks and feels the same as you. If both of you constantly struggle to come to a mutual conclusion. Then clearly, he doesn't view love the pattern you desired. From there, you should be able to find the answer you looking for. But if your argument always like comparing with other guys, to be honest, he might feel intimidated or insecure and this usually will lead to defensive behaviour. Just focus on the main issue - communication and understanding. Good luck"

0,"I hereby stand as a proof that there are ppl from not as advanced in socialising practises who are still learning very hard to take up the gifting practices. Can’t say for your bf but it’s not fair to jump to that “not thinking of you” just because of no gift.

Every time I see ppl doing it I’m just super astonished. More so on how immensely happy the receiving side is. I don’t even know how I should feel when gifted with small things. Not that I never thought about my friends - things do reminds me of my friends and I would miss my friends as well, but it’s like the option of gifting it never appeared in that page of my dictionary.

Now I’m just trying to learn but it’s daunting. Now I keep thinking if I should gift during each socialising occasion, and yet it’s such a sophisticated culture. You have to know what to gift (because Chinese have a lot of taboos), and whether it would be awkward to gift that given the setting, what’s the budget (cuz sometimes ppl reject higher priced gifts) and so much more.

If he doesn’t prioritise you, take into consideration your feelings nor respect your time etc, leave before you feel further taken for granted. Learn from my mistake. Tc."
